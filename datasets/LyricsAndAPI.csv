Open up your plans and damn you're free  
Look into your heart and you'll find love love love love

We are just one big family  
And It's our God-forsaken right to be loved loved loved loved loved

So I won't hesitate no more, no more  
It cannot wait I'm sure  
There's no need to complicate

This is our fate, I'm yours  
  
I've been spending way too long checking my tongue in the mirror  
And bending over backwards just to try to see it clearer  
But my breath fogged up the glass  
And so I drew a new face and I laughed  
I guess what I been saying is there ain't no better reason  
To rid yourself of vanity and just go with the seasons  
It's what we aim to do  
Our name is our virtue  
  
But I won't hesitate no more, no more  
It cannot wait I'm yours  
  
Well open up your mind and see like me  
Open up your plans and damn you're free  
Look into your heart and you'll find the sky is yours

A marble dog that chases cars  
To farthest reaches of the beach and far beyond into the swimming sea of stars  
  
A cosmic fish they love to kiss  
They're giving birth to constellation

If they should fall you get a wish or dedication  
May I suggest you get the best

Of leads to infinite number  
Crashing waves and breaking thunder  
Tiding the evenflows of hunger  
You're dancing naked there for me  
You expose all memory  
You make the most of boundary  
You're the ghost of royalty imposing love  
You are the queen and king combining everything  
Into twining like a ring around the finger of a girl  
I'm just a singer, you're the world  
All I can bring ya  
Is the language of a lover

Yeah, you figured me out  
Something gave it away

And baby that's a case of my wishful thinking

Why, we go carrying on for hours, on and  
We get along much better  
Than you and your boyfriend

A kind much closer than friends use  
But I still can't say it after all we've been through

As the feeling inside keeps building  
And I will find a way to you if it kills me  
If it kills me  
  
Well how long, can I go on like this,  
Wishing to kiss you,  
Before I rightly explode?  
This double life I lead isn't healthy for me

Baby there's a lot that I miss  
In case I'm wrong

I'd ask you to hold my heart in your hand  
Tell you from the start how I've longed to be your man

When I stole my first rhyme from the M.I.C.  
At a west end avenue at 63

Like a band of gypsies on the highway while  
I'm one man pushin' on the California skyline drive

I got Elsa the dog who exceeds my limitation

Look at my flexibility  
Dangerous at the mike

Smelled of childhood remnants of a dusty weeping willow  
Clouds soothe, Shredded by the calico  
Were oh so vast and quick as I was on my own now.

Another sweet little girl with sequined sea foam eyes  
Ocean lapping voice smile coy as the brightest quiet span of sky

Still I've got cobblestone joints and plate glass points

Stare at the beautiful women  
""She's looking at you. Ah, no, no, she's looking at me.""  
Smiling in the bright lights  
Coming through in stereo  
When everybody loves you, you can never be lonely  
  
I will paint my picture  
Paint myself in blue and red and black and gray  
All of the beautiful colors are very very meaningful  
Grey is my favorite color  
I felt so symbolic yesterday  
If I knew Picasso  
I would buy myself a gray guitar and play  
  
Mr. Jones and me look into the future  
Stare at the beautiful women  
""She's looking at you.  
Uh, I don't think so. She's looking at me.""  
Standing in the spotlight  
I bought myself a gray guitar  
When everybody loves me, I will never be lonely  
  
I want to be a lion  
Everybody wants to pass as cats  
We all want to be big big stars, but we got different reasons for that Believe  
in me because I don't believe in anything  
and I want to be someone to believe  
  
Mr. Jones and me stumbling through the barrio  
Yeah we star at the beautiful women  
""She's perfect for you, Man, there's got to be somebody for me.""  
I want to be Bob Dylan  
Mr. Jones wishes he was someone just a little more funky  
When everybody loves you, son, that's just about as funky as you can be  
  
Mr. Jones and me staring at the video  
When I look at the television, I want to see me staring right back at me  
We all want to be big stars, but we don't know why and we don't know how  
But when everybody loves me, I'm going to be just about as happy as can be  
Mr. Jones and me, we're gonna be big stars

The birth of every other nation

Win or lose just like you  
Far more shocking

Ten more reasons  
Why I need somebody new just like you

Kick start the golden generator  
Sweet talk but don't intimidate her  
Can't stop the gods from engineering  
Feel no need for any interfering  
Your image in the dictionary

Coming from space  
To teach you of the pliedes  
Can't stop the spirits when they need you

Papa was a copper, and mama was a hippie  
In Alabama she would swing a hammer  
Price you got to pay when you break the panorama  
She never knew that there was anything more than all  
What in the world does your compliment take me for?  
Black bandana, sweet Louisiana  
Robbing on a bank in the state of Indiana  
She's a runner  
Rebel, and a stunner  
On her merry way sayin ""Baby, watcha gonna?""  
Looking down the barrel of a hot metal forty-five  
Just another way to survive

A little loaded,she was stealin' another breath  
I love my baby to death...

Who knew that others died to prove?  
Too true to say goodbye to you  
Too true to say, say, say

Gifted animator  
One for the now  
And eleven for the later  
Never made it up to Minnesota

Was a gunnin' for the quota  
Down in the Badlands she was savin' the best for last  
It only hurts when I laugh  
Gone to fast

There's no blood, there's no alibi  
'Cause I've drawn regret  
From the truth of a thousand lies  
So let mercy come and wash away  
What I've done  
  
I'll face myself to cross out what I've become  
Erase myself  
And let go of what I've done  
  
Put to rest what you thought of me  
While I clean this slate  
With the hands of uncertainty

Erase myself  
And let go of what I've done

I start again  
And whatever pain may come  
Today this ends  
I'm forgiving what I've done

Just got my license back  
I got this feeling in my veins this train is coming off the track  
I'll ask polite if the devil needs a ride  
Because the angel on my right ain't hanging out with me tonight  
I'm driving past your house while you were sneaking out  
I got the car door opened up so you can jump in on the run  
Your mom don't know that you were missing  
She'd be pissed if she could see the parts of you that I've been kissing

Ain't nothing wrong with it

We're just a couple of animals  
  
So come on baby, get in  
Get in, just get in  
Check out the trouble we're in  
  
You're beside me on the seat  
Got your hand between my knees  
And you control how fast we go by just how hard you wanna squeeze  
It's hard to steer when you're breathing in my ear  
But I got both hands on the wheel while you got both hands on my gears  
By now, no doubt that we were heading south  
I guess nobody ever taught her not to speak with a full mouth  
Cause this was it, like flicking on a switch  
It felt so good I almost drove into the ditch  
I'm screamin'  
  
[Chorus]  
  
So come on baby, get in  
Get in, just get in  
Look at the trouble we're in  
  
We were parked out by the tracks  
We're sitting in the back  
And we just started getting busy  
When she whispered ""what was that?""  
The wind, I think 'cause no one else knows where we are  
And that was when she started screamin'  
""That's my dad outside the car!""  
Oh please, the keys, they're not in the ignition  
Must have wound up on the floor while  
we were switching our positions  
I guess they knew that she was missing  
As I tried to tell her dad it was her mouth that I was kissing  
Screamin'

Singing songs off station to station

It's the simple things in life, like when and where  
We didn't have no internet  
But man I never will forget  
The way the moonlight shined upon her hair  
  
[Chorus]  
And we were trying different things  
We were smoking funny things  
Making love out by the lake to our favorite song  
Sipping whiskey out the bottle, not thinking 'bout tomorrow  
Singing Sweet home Alabama all summer long  
Singing Sweet home Alabama all summer long  
  
Catching Walleye from the dock  
Watching the waves roll off the rocks  
She'll forever hold a spot inside my soul  
We'd blister in the sun  
We couldn't wait for night to come  
To hit that sand and play some rock and roll  
  
While we were trying different things  
And we were smoking funny things  
Making love out by the lake to our favorite song  
Sipping whiskey out the bottle, not thinking 'bout tomorrow  
Singing Sweet Home Alabama all summer long  
Singing Sweet Home Alabama all summer long  
  
Now nothing seems as strange as when the leaves began to change  
Or how we thought those days would never end  
Sometimes I'll hear that song and I'll start to sing along  
And think man I'd love to see that girl again  
  
[Chorus: x 2]  
  
Singing Sweet Home Alabama all summer long  
Singing Sweet Home Alabama all summer long  
Singing Sweet Home Alabama all summer long  
Singing Sweet Home Alabama all summer long

Maybe this year will be better than the last  
I can't remember the last thing that you said as you were leavin'  
Now the days go by so fast  
  
And it's one more day up in the canyons  
And it's one more night in Hollywood  
If you think that I could be forgiven I wish you would  
  
The smell of hospitals in winter  
And the feeling that it's all a lot of oysters, but no pearls  
All at once you look across a crowded room  
To see the way that light attaches to a girl  
  
And it's one more day up in the canyons  
And it's one more night in Hollywood  
If you think you might come to California I think you should  
  
Drove up to Hillside Manor sometime after two a.m.  
And talked a little while about the year  
I guess the winter makes you laugh a little slower,  
Makes you talk a little lower about the things you could not show her  
  
And it's been a long December and there's reason to believe  
Maybe this year will be better than the last  
I can't remember all the times I tried to tell my myself  
To hold on to these moments as they pass  
  
And it's one more day up in the canyon  
And it's one more night in Hollywood  
It's been so long since I've seen the ocean I guess I should

More wood for the fires, loud neighbors  
Flashlight reveries caught in the headlights of a truck  
Eating seeds as a pastime activity  
The toxicity of our city, of our city  
  
Now, what do you own the world?  
How do you own disorder, disorder  
Now somewhere between the sacred silence  
Sacred silence and sleep  
Somewhere between the sacred silence and sleep  
Disorder, disorder, disorder  
  
You, what do you own the world?  
How do you own disorder?  
Now somewhere between the sacred silence  
Sacred silence and sleep  
Somewhere, between the sacred silence and sleep  
Disorder, disorder, disorder  
  
When I became the sun  
I shone life into the man's hearts  
When I became the sun  
I shone life into the man's hearts

Ten more reasons

Sweet talk but don't intimidate her  
Can't stop the gods from engineering  
Feel no need for any interfering  
Your image in the dictionary

Can I get two maybe even three of these  
Coming from space  
To teach you of the pliedes  
Can't stop the spirits when they need you

Meant the time had come

Searching, seeking

He's gone  
To the temple of the king  
  
Far from the circle at the edge of the world  
He's hoping, wondering  
Thinking back from the stories he's heard  
Of what he's going to see  
  
There in middle of the circle it lies

I didn't give to you  
  
Old friend, why are you so shy  
Ain't like you to hold back  
Or hide from the light  
  
I hate to turn up out of the blue uninvited but I  
Couldn't stay away I couldn't fight it  
I had hoped you'd see my face  
And that you be reminded that for me it isn't over  
  
Never mind I'll find someone like you  
I wish nothing but the best  
For you too, don't forget me  
I beg, I'll remember you say  
Sometimes it lasts in love  
But sometimes it hurts instead  
Sometimes it lasts in love  
But sometimes it hurts instead yeah  
  
You know how the time flies  
Only yesterday it was the time of our lives  
We were born and raised  
In a summer haze bound by the surprise  
Of our glory days  
  
I hate to turn up out of the blue uninvited but I  
Couldn't stay away I couldn't fight it  
I hoped you'd see my face  
And that you'd be reminded that for me it isn't over  
  
Never mind I'll find someone like you  
I wish nothing but the best for you too  
Don't forget me I beg, I'll remember you say  
Sometimes it lasts in love but sometimes it hurts instead  
  
Nothing compares no worries or cares  
Regrets and mistakes their memories made  
Who would have known how bittersweet  
This would taste  
  
Never mind I'll find someone like you  
I wish nothing but the best for you  
Don't forget me I beg, I'll remember you say  
Sometimes it lasts in love but sometimes it hurts instead  
  
Never mind I'll find someone like you  
I wish nothing but the best for you too  
Don't forget me I beg, I'll remember you say  
Sometimes it lasts in love but sometimes it hurts instead  
  
Sometimes it lasts in love but sometimes it hurts instead

From the way you talk  
To the way you move  
Everybody here is watching you  
Cause you feel like home  
You're like a dream come true  
But if by chance you're here alone  
Can I have a moment  
Before I go?  
Cause I've been by myself all night long  
Hoping you're someone I used to know

At least I can say that I've tried to tell you  
I'm sorry, for breaking your heart  
But it don't matter, it clearly doesn't tear you apart anymore

Hello, how are you?  
It's so typical of me to talk about myself  
I'm sorry, I hope that you're well  
Did you ever make it out of that town  
Where nothing ever happened?

That the both of us are running out of time

As I step down from the train,  
And there to meet me is my Mama and Papa.  
Down the road I look and there runs Mary  
Hair of gold and lips like cherries.  
  
It's good to touch the green, green grass of home.  
Yes, they'll all come to meet me, arms reaching, smiling sweetly.

The old house is still standing tho' the paint is cracked and dry,  
And there's that old oak tree that I used to play on.  
Down the lane I walk with my sweet Mary,  
Hair of gold and lips like cherries.  
It's good to touch the green, green grass of home.  
  
Then I awake and look around me,  
At four grey walls that surround me  
And I realize, yes, I was only dreaming.  
For there's a guard and there's a sad old padre,  
Arm in arm, we'll walk at daybreak.  
Again I touch the green, green grass of home.  
  
Yes, they'll all come to see me  
In the shade of that old oak tree  
As they lay me 'neath the green, green grass of home.

I saw your lips I heard your voice  
believe me I just had no choice  
Wild horses couldn't make me stay away  
I thought about a moonlit night  
My arms about good an' tight  
That's all I had to see for me to say  
  
[Chorus]

Playa del Carmen  
That's when I first met Jose  
He had a 12 foot Schooner  
A 3 foot cooler  
Full of the catch of the day  
And he was wrinkled from grinning  
From all of the sun he had been in  
He was barefoot, cerveza in hand  
He said ""Gracias senor"", when I paid him too much for  
All of the Snapper he had  
Now I told him my friend it ain't nothing  
In the best broken Spanish I knew  
I said I make a good living  
Back home where I'm from  
He smiled and said Amigo me too  
  
He said I fish and I play my guitar  
I laugh at the bar with my friends  
I go home to my wife  
I pray every night  
I can do it all over again  
  
Somewhere over Texas  
I thought of my Lexus  
And all the stuff I work so hard for  
And all the things that I've gathered  
From climbing that ladder  
Didn't make much sense anymore  
They say my nest egg ain't ready to hatch yet  
They keep holding my feet to the fire  
They call it paying the price  
So that one day in life  
I'll have what I need to retire  
  
And just fish  
And play my guitar  
And laugh at the bar with my friends  
And go home to my wife  
And pray every night  
I can do it all over again  
  
And to think that I thought for a while there that I had it made  
When the truth is I'm really just dying  
To live like Jose  
  
And just fish  
Play my guitar  
Laugh at the bar with my friends  
Go home to my wife  
Pray every night  
I can do it all over again  
  
Wouldn't that be the life?  
Wouldn't that be the life?

Don't know you're not home.

And your sunglasses on, baby.  
I can tell you my love for you will still be strong  
After the boys of summer have gone.

I wonder if it was a dream.  
Remember how you made me crazy,  
Remember how I made you scream.  
I don't understand what happened to our love.  
But, baby, I'm gonna get you back,  
I'm gonna show you what I'm made of.  
  
I can see you,

I see you walking real slow  
And you're smiling at everyone.  
And I can tell you my love for you will still be strong

Out on the road today I saw a Deadhead sticker on a Cadillac.  
A little voice inside my head said:  
""Don't look back, you can never look back.""  
I thought I knew what love was.  
What did I know?  
Those days are gone forever.  
I should just let 'em go, but  
  
I can see you,  
Your brown skin shining in the sun.  
You got that top pulled down,  
And that radio on, baby.  
And I can tell you my love for you will still be strong,

You're giving me a million reasons to quit the show  
You're givin' me a million reasons  
Give me a million reasons  
Givin' me a million reasons  
About a million reasons  
  
If I had a highway, I would run for the hills  
If you could find a dry way, I'd forever be still  
But you're giving me a million reasons  
Give me a million reasons  
Givin' me a million reasons

I try to make the worst seem better  
Lord, show me the way  
To cut through all his worn out leather  
I've got a hundred million reasons to walk away  
But baby, I just need one good one to stay  
  
[Verse 2]  
Head stuck in a cycle, I look off and I stare  
It's like that I've stopped breathing, but completely aware  
'Cause you're giving me a million reasons  
Give me a million reasons  
Givin' me a million reasons  
About a million reasons  
  
And if you say something that you might even mean  
It's hard to even fathom which parts I should believe  
'Cause you're giving me a million reasons  
Give me a million reasons  
Givin' me a million reasons  
About a million reasons

But baby, I just need one good one to stay

Hey, ehh, ehh, eyy  
Baby I'm bleedin', bleedin'  
Stay, ehh, ehhy  
Can't you give me what I'm needin', needin'  
Every heartbreak makes it hard to keep the faith  
But baby, I just need one good one  
Good one, good one, good one, good one, good one  
  
[Chorus]  
When I bow down to pray  
I try to make the worst seem better  
Lord, show me the way  
To cut through all his worn out leather  
I've got a hundred million reasons to walk away  
But baby, I just need one good one, good one  
Tell me that you'll be the good one, good one  
Baby, I just need one good one to stay

Begin new life  
Bleed your death upon me  
Let your bloodline feed my youth  
  
Blame god chosen children

Faithless no religion  
Stalking prey is my confession  
Captive blood enslavement  
Pain and hunger drives your madness  
Drink flesh life itself

Something's wrong with the way she walks the aisle  
I think it's her legs  
  
Suddenly there is someone else beside her  
That man I recognize  
The Doctor intends to marry Mother  
It's got to be stopped  
  
Now what have I done  
My Mother's on the floor and the Doctor's gone  
Everything is wrong  
And as I keep the axe I wonder what's to come  
  
I'm caught within a dream there's no way out  
I can't escape

I might escape the dream  
The wedding dream  
Oh the dream  
  
Now everything turns to darkness  
Deep within I feel like I'm going blind  
There is a light at the end of this starless nightmare  
Someone's calling, guiding me back inside  
The dream  
No  
  
Get away from him Mother  
You better stop kissing, 'cause he's an enemy  
Take at look at his hand  
He's got the key to my house, the Doctor is the devil

The dream I was sent is fading slowly

He was big and strong, in his eyes a flaming glow  
Most people looked at him with terror and with fear  
But to Moscow chicks he was such a lovely dear  
He could preach the bible like a preacher  
Full of ecstasy and fire  
But he also was the kind of teacher  
Women would desire

Lover of the Russian queen  
There was a cat that really was gone  
Ra ra Rasputin

It was a shame how he carried on  
  
He ruled the Russian land and never mind the czar  
But the cassock he danced really wunderbar  
In all affairs of state he was the man to please  
But he was real great when he had a girl to squeeze  
For the queen he was no wheeler dealer  
Though she'd heard the things he'd done  
She believed he was a holy healer  
Who would heal her son  
  
But when his drinking and lusting and his hunger  
For power became known to more and more people,  
The demands to do something about this outrageous  
Man became louder and louder.  
  
""This man's just got to go!"" declared his enemies  
But the ladies begged ""don't you try to do it, please""  
No doubt this Rasputin had lots of hidden charms  
Though he was a brute they just fell into his arms  
Then one night some men of higher standing  
Set a trap, they're not to blame  
""Come to visit us"" they kept demanding  
And he really came  
  
Ra ra Rasputin  
Lover of the Russian queen  
They put some poison into his wine

Russia's greatest love machine  
He drank it all and he said ""I feel fine""  
  
Ra ra Rasputin  
Lover of the Russian queen  
They didn't quit, they wanted his head  
Ra ra Rasputin  
Russia's greatest love machine  
And so they shot him till he was dead  
  
Oh, those Russians

Ma Baker  
But she knew how to die  
  
They left a trail of crime  
Across the USA  
And when one boy was killed  
She really made them pay  
She had no heart at all  
No no no heart at all

She met a man she liked  
She thought she'd stay with him  
One day he informed on them  
They did away with him  
She didn't care at all  
Just didn't care at all  
  
Here is a special bulletin  
Ma Baker is the FBI's most wanted woman  
Her photo is hanging on every post office wall  
If you have any information about this woman  
Please contact the nearest police station  
  
Don't anybody move the money or your life  
One day they robbed a bank  
It was last foray  
The cops appeared too soon  
They couldn't get away  
With all the loot they had  
It made them mighty mad  
And so they shot it out  
Ma Baker and her sons  
They didn't want to hang  
They died with blazing guns  
And so the story ends  
Of one who left no friends

He was big and strong, in his eyes a flaming glow  
Most people looked at him with terror and with fear  
But to Moscow chicks he was such a lovely dear  
He could preach the bible like a preacher  
Full of ecstasy and fire  
But he also was the kind of teacher  
Women would desire  
  
Ra ra Rasputin  
Lover of the Russian queen  
There was a cat that really was gone  
Ra ra Rasputin  
Russia's greatest love machine  
It was a shame how he carried on  
  
He ruled the Russian land and never mind the czar  
But the cassock he danced really wunderbar  
In all affairs of state he was the man to please  
But he was real great when he had a girl to squeeze  
For the queen he was no wheeler dealer  
Though she'd heard the things he'd done  
She believed he was a holy healer  
Who would heal her son  
  
But when his drinking and lusting and his hunger  
For power became known to more and more people,  
The demands to do something about this outrageous  
Man became louder and louder.  
  
""This man's just got to go!"" declared his enemies  
But the ladies begged ""don't you try to do it, please""  
No doubt this Rasputin had lots of hidden charms  
Though he was a brute they just fell into his arms  
Then one night some men of higher standing  
Set a trap, they're not to blame  
""Come to visit us"" they kept demanding  
And he really came  
  
Ra ra Rasputin  
Lover of the Russian queen  
They put some poison into his wine  
Ra ra Rasputin  
Russia's greatest love machine  
He drank it all and he said ""I feel fine""  
  
Ra ra Rasputin  
Lover of the Russian queen  
They didn't quit, they wanted his head  
Ra ra Rasputin  
Russia's greatest love machine  
And so they shot him till he was dead  
  
Oh, those Russians

Down below the cars in the city go rushing by.  
I sit here alone and I wonder why.  
  
Friday night and everyone's moving.  
I can feel the heat but it's soothing.  
Heading down, I search for the beat in this dirty town.  
  
Down town the young ones are going.  
Down town the young ones are growing.  
We're the kids in America.  
Everybody live for the music-go-round.  
  
Bright lights the music get faster.  
Look boy, don't check on your watch, not another glance.  
I'm not leaving now, honey not a chance.  
  
Hot-shot, give me no problems.  
Much later baby you'll be saying never mind.  
You know life is cruel, life is never kind.  
  
Kind hearts don't make a new story.  
Kind hearts don't grab any glory.  
We're the kids in America.  
Everybody live for the music-go-round.  
  
Come closer, honey that's better.  
Got to get a brand new experience.  
Feeling right.  
Oh don't try to stop baby.  
Hold me tight.  
  
Outside a new day is dawning.  
Outside Suburbia's sprawling everywhere.  
I don't want to go baby.  
New York to East California.  
There's a new wave coming I warn you.  
  
We're the kids in America.  
Everybody live for the music-go-round.  
We're the kids in America.

Got a feeling most would treasure  
And a love so deep we cannot measure

I could make a woman hang on every single stroke

I'm still alone

And all the hearts in all creation

Living love between the line  
We came (sha la) so close (so far)  
Just the beat of a lonely heart  
And it's mine, and I don't want to be alone  
  
Well, since I got no message on your answer phone  
Since you're busy every minute I just stay at home  
I make believe you care, I feel you everywhere  
But I'm still alone  
  
I'm on a wheel of fortune with a twist of fate  
'Cause I know it isn't heaven is it love or hate  
Am I the subject of the pain  
Am I the stranger in the rain I am alone  
  
And is there glory there to behold  
Maybe it's my imagination another story there to be told  
So I play sha la, I'll wait sha la  
And I pray it's not too late  
We came sha la so far so far  
Just a beat of a lonely heart and it's mi-i-ine  
And I don't want to be alone

Gone but not out of sight  
I'm caught in the rain and there's no one home  
I don't want to be alone face the heat of the the night  
The one that you love's got a heart that's made of stone  
You search for the light  
And sooner or later you'll be cruising on your ocean  
And clean out of sight I'm caught in the rain  
And there's no one home

And I wish I could be in orchard road

I think Ive got a job  
They're gonna call me next week  
And I'll be working out of town  
But it sure beats hanging around  
  
What's that? Tomorrow at two  
You're kidding me, no  
Is it alright with you  
I don't know what to say  
It'll be like a holiday  
  
When you say you're all alone  
Makes me wanna come back  
And this house is not a home  
I just gotta go back  
  
Its twelve ten when I put down the phone  
The moons shining down on orchard road  
And I'm feeling like a schoolboy again and tonight  
Ill see you in my dreams of orchard road  
  
Its funny but I thought I'd never go back  
I think sometimes I might loose track  
But I remember you and the things we do  
And I want it back.  
  
In orchard road you've got my heart  
I left it in your doorway  
In orchard road a welcome back  
Is waiting there just for me  
In orchard road the sun will shine  
Again I know I know  
In orchard road you keep my love  
Just waiting there for me  
  
Its eight o'clock and the dawns arrived  
In orchard road it's breakfast time  
I climb in my car and I turn the key and I'm gone  
I am coming home  
To orchard road  
  
I'm coming home

This year  
To save me from tears  
I'll give it to someone special.  
  
A face on a lover with a fire in his heart (I gave you my heart)  
A man under cover but you tore him apart  
Maybe next year I'll give it to someone  
I'll give it to someone special.  
  
Special...  
Someone...

Suitcases of memories,

Sometimes you picture me  
I'm walking too far ahead  
You're calling to me, I can't hear  
What you've said  
Then you say, go slow  
I fall behind

Turned to gray  
Watching through windows

Secrets stolen from deep inside  
The drum beats out of time

If you have any information about this woman  
Please contact the nearest police station  
  
Don't anybody move the money or your life  
One day they robbed a bank  
It was last foray  
The cops appeared too soon  
They couldn't get away  
With all the loot they had  
It made them mighty mad  
And so they shot it out  
Ma Baker and her sons  
They didn't want to hang  
They died with blazing guns  
And so the story ends  
Of one who left no friends  
  
Ma ma ma ma  
Ma Baker  
She taught her four sons  
Ma ma ma ma  
Ma Baker  
To handle there guns  
Ma ma ma ma  
Ma Baker  
She never could cry  
Ma ma ma ma  
Ma Baker  
But she knew how to die

And all I said was ""Hello, hello""  
Tell me how to say ""goodbye,"" cause it's goodbye  
  
[Chorus]  
I can't stay on my knees  
Give me some mercy, please  
It's alright, let it die  
I wanted everything  
More than your love could give  
It's alright, let it die

Losing it all on my own

The strength I need to push me

Touch my own skin

And I think back to when  
My brother and my sister slept  
In another place  
The only time I feel safe

Stuck in the jet wash,  
Bad trip I couldn't get off.  
And maybe I bit off more than I could chew,  
And overhead of the aqua blue.  
Fall to your knees bring on the rapture,  
Blessed be the boys time can't capture.  
On film or between the sheets,  
I always fall from your window,  
To the pitch black streets.

As the crooked smiles fade.  
Former heroes who quit too late,  
Just wanna fill up the trophy case again.

I'm not passive but aggressive,  
Take note, it's not impressive.  
Empty your sadness like you're dumping your purse on my bedroom floor,  
We put your curse in reverse.  
And it's our time now if you want to to be,  
Maul the world like the carnival bears set free.  
And your love is anemic and I can't believe,  
That you couldn't see it coming from me.

And I still feel that rush in my veins,  
It twists my head just a bit too thin.  
All those people I see in those old photographs I've seen are dead.

I had a feeling I could be someone, be someone, be someone  
  
You got a fast car  
But is it fast enough so you can fly away  
You gotta make a decision  
Leave tonight or live and die this way

In colors on the snowy linen land

How you tried to set them free

Flaming flowers that brightly blaze  
Swirling clouds in violet haze

Are soothed beneath the artist's loving hand

You took your life as lovers often do  
But I could have told you, Vincent  
This world was never meant  
For one as beautiful as you  
  
Starry, starry night  
Portraits hung in empty halls  
Frameless heads on nameless walls  
With eyes that watch the world and can't forget  
Like the strangers that you've met  
The ragged men in ragged clothes  
A silver thorn, a bloody rose  
Lie crushed and broken on the virgin snow

And he's quick with a joke or to light up your smoke

If I could get out of this place""

Now Paul is a real estate novelist  
Who never had time for a wife  
And he's talkin' with Davy, who's still in the Navy  
And probably will be for life  
  
And the waitress is practicing politics  
As the businessmen slowly get stoned  
Yes, they're sharing a drink they call loneliness  
But it's better than drinkin' alone

Sing us a song tonight

It's a pretty good crowd for a Saturday  
And the manager gives me a smile  
'Cause he knows that it's me they've been comin' to see  
To forget about life for a while  
And the piano, it sounds like a carnival  
And the microphone smells like a beer  
And they sit at the bar and put bread in my jar  
And say, ""Man, what are you doin' here?""

Hiding behind a rainbow's wall,  
Slipping and sliding  
All along the water fall, with you  
My brown eyed girl,  
You're my brown eyed girl.  
  
Do you remember when we used to sing,  
Sha la la la la la la la la la la te da  
Just like that  
Sha la la la la la la la la la la te da, la te da  
  
So hard to find my way,  
Now that I'm all on my own.  
I saw you just the other day,  
My how you have grown,  
Cast my memory back there, Lord  
Sometime I'm overcome thinking 'bout  
Making love in the green grass  
Behind the stadium with you  
My brown eyed girl  
You're my brown eyed girl  
  
Do you remember when we used to sing  
Sha la la la la la la la la la la te da (lying in the green grass)  
Sha la la la la la la la la la la te da (bit, bit, bit, bit, bit, bit)  
Sha la la la la la la la la la la te da (sha la la la la la...)  
Sha la la la la la la la la la la te da

That David played, and it pleased the Lord

Your faith was strong but you needed proof  
You saw her bathing on the roof  
Her beauty and the moonlight overthrew her  
She tied you  
To a kitchen chair  
She broke your throne, and she cut your hair  
And from your lips she drew the Hallelujah  
  
Hallelujah, Hallelujah  
Hallelujah, Hallelujah  
You say I took the name in vain  
I don't even know the name  
But if I did, well really, what's it to you?  
There's a blaze of light  
In every word  
It doesn't matter which you heard  
The holy or the broken Hallelujah  
  
Hallelujah, Hallelujah  
Hallelujah, Hallelujah  
  
I did my best, it wasn't much  
I couldn't feel, so I tried to touch  
I've told the truth, I didn't come to fool you  
And even though  
It all went wrong  
I'll stand before the Lord of Song  
With nothing on my tongue but Hallelujah  
  
Hallelujah, Hallelujah  
Hallelujah, Hallelujah  
Hallelujah, Hallelujah  
Hallelujah, Hallelujah  
Hallelujah, Hallelujah

Try to steal your mind's elation  
And little girls from Sweden

It's the edge of the world  
And all of western civilization  
The sun may rise in the East  
At least it settles in the final location  
It's understood that Hollywood  
Sells Californication

Or is that war your waging

Be my very own constellation  
A teenage bride with a baby inside  
Getting high on information  
And buy me a star on the boulevard  
It's Californication  
  
Space may be the final frontier  
But it's made in a Hollywood basement  
Cobain can you hear the spheres  
Singing songs off station to station  
And Alderaan's not far away  
It's Californication  
  
Born and raised by those who praise  
Control of population everybody's been there and  
I don't mean on vacation  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Destruction leads to a very rough road  
But it also breeds creation  
And earthquakes are to a girl's guitar  
They're just another good vibration  
And tidal waves couldn't save the world  
From Californication  
  
Pay your surgeon very well  
To break the spell of aging  
Sicker than the rest  
There is no test  
But this is what you're craving

Killing helpless men, women and children

May I give him the star you gave to me?""

Try to steal your mind's elation  
And little girls from Sweden

And if you want these kind of dreams

It's the edge of the world  
And all of western civilization  
The sun may rise in the East  
At least it settles in the final location  
It's understood that Hollywood  
Sells Californication

Or is that war your waging

Be my very own constellation  
A teenage bride with a baby inside  
Getting high on information  
And buy me a star on the boulevard

Space may be the final frontier  
But it's made in a Hollywood basement  
Cobain can you hear the spheres  
Singing songs off station to station  
And Alderaan's not far away  
It's Californication  
  
Born and raised by those who praise  
Control of population everybody's been there and  
I don't mean on vacation

Destruction leads to a very rough road  
But it also breeds creation  
And earthquakes are to a girl's guitar

And tidal waves couldn't save the world  
From Californication  
  
Pay your surgeon very well  
To break the spell of aging  
Sicker than the rest  
There is no test  
But this is what you're craving

Soldiers passing by

That we could be so close, like brothers  
The future's in the air  
I can feel it everywhere  
Blowing with the wind of change  
  
Take me to the magic of the moment  
On a glory night  
Where the children of tomorrow dream away  
In the wind of change  
  
Walking down the street  
Distant memories  
Are buried in the past forever

The wind of change  
Blows straight into the face of time  
Like a stormwind that will ring the freedom bell  
For peace of mind  
Let your balalaika sing  
What my guitar wants to say  
  
Take me to the magic of the moment  
On a glory night  
Where the children of tomorrow share their dreams  
With you and me  
Take me to the magic of the moment  
On a glory night

And you control how fast we go by just how hard you wanna squeeze  
It's hard to steer when you're breathing in my ear

By now, no doubt that we were heading south

And we just started getting busy  
When she whispered ""what was that?""  
The wind, I think 'cause no one else knows where we are  
And that was when she started screamin'  
""That's my dad outside the car!""  
Oh please, the keys, they're not in the ignition  
Must have wound up on the floor while  
we were switching our positions  
I guess they knew that she was missing

Leave old pictures in the past  
Donate every dime you have?

I got to say something.  
Lightweights stepping aside,  
When we come in.  
Feel it in your chest,  
The syllables get pumping.  
People on the street,  
They panic and start running.  
Words on loose leaf,  
Sheet complete coming.  
I jump on my mind,  
I summon the rhyme I'm dumping.  
Healing the blind,  
I promise to let the sun in.  
Sick of the dark ways,  
We march to the drumming.  
Jump when they tell us  
They want to see jumping.  
Fuck that, I want to  
See some fist pumping.  
Risk something.  
Take back what's yours  
Say something that you know  
They might attack you for  
'Cause I'm sick of being treated  
Like I had before.  
Like it's stupid standing for  
What I'm standing for.  
Like this war is really just  
A different brand of war.  
Like it doesn't cater the rich  
And an abandon the poor.  
Like they understand you  
In the back of the jet,  
When you can't put gas in your tank.  
These fuckers are laughing their way  
To the bank and cashing their check  
Asking you to have compassion and to have some respect.  
  
For a leader so nervous  
In an obvious way  
Stuttering and mumbling  
For nightly news to replay  
And the rest of the world  
Watching at the end of the day  
In the living room laughing  
Like what did he say?  
  
Amen, amen, amen, amen, amen  
  
In my living room watching,  
But I am not laughing.  
'Cause when it gets tense,  
I know what might happen.  
The world is cold,  
The bold men take action.  
Have to react,  
Or get blown into fractions.  
Ten years old is something to see,  
Another kid my age drugged under a jeep,  
Taken and bound and found later under a tree,  
I wonder if he thought the ""next one could be me"".  
Do you see?  
The soldiers they're out today.  
That brush the dust from bulletproof vests away.  
It's ironic,  
At times like this you pray,  
But a bomb blew the mosque up yesterday.  
There's bombs in the buses, bikes, roads,  
Inside your markets, your shops, your clothes,  
My dad, he's got a lot of fear I know  
But enough pride inside not to let that show.  
My brother had a book he would hold with pride  
A little red cover with a broken spine.  
In the back he hand wrote a quote inside,  
When the rich wage war, it's the poor who die.  
  
Meanwhile, the leader just talks away  
Stuttering and mumbling  
For nightly news to replay  
And the rest of the world  
Watching at the end of the day  
Both scared and angry  
Like what did he say?  
  
Amen, amen, amen, amen, amen.  
  
With hands held high  
Into a sky so blue  
As the ocean opens up  
To swallow you.  
  
With hands held high  
Into a sky so blue  
The ocean opens up  
To swallow you.  
  
With hands held high  
Into a sky so blue  
The ocean opens up  
To swallow you.  
  
With hands held high  
Into a sky so blue  
The ocean opens up  
To swallow you.  
  
With hands held high  
Into a sky so blue  
The ocean opens up  
To swallow you.  
  
With hands held high  
Into a sky so blue  
The ocean opens up  
To swallow you.

And you control how fast we go by just how hard you wanna squeeze  
It's hard to steer when you're breathing in my ear

By now, no doubt that we were heading south  
I guess nobody ever taught her not to speak with a full mouth

It felt so good I almost drove into the ditch

We were parked out by the tracks  
We're sitting in the back  
And we just started getting busy  
When she whispered ""what was that?""  
The wind, I think 'cause no one else knows where we are  
And that was when she started screamin'  
""That's my dad outside the car!""  
Oh please, the keys, they're not in the ignition  
Must have wound up on the floor while  
we were switching our positions  
I guess they knew that she was missing

I got to say something.  
Lightweights stepping aside,  
When we come in.  
Feel it in your chest,  
The syllables get pumping.  
People on the street,  
They panic and start running.  
Words on loose leaf,  
Sheet complete coming.  
I jump on my mind,  
I summon the rhyme I'm dumping.  
Healing the blind,  
I promise to let the sun in.  
Sick of the dark ways,  
We march to the drumming.  
Jump when they tell us  
They want to see jumping.  
Fuck that, I want to  
See some fist pumping.  
Risk something.  
Take back what's yours  
Say something that you know  
They might attack you for  
'Cause I'm sick of being treated  
Like I had before.  
Like it's stupid standing for  
What I'm standing for.  
Like this war is really just  
A different brand of war.  
Like it doesn't cater the rich  
And an abandon the poor.  
Like they understand you  
In the back of the jet,  
When you can't put gas in your tank.  
These fuckers are laughing their way  
To the bank and cashing their check  
Asking you to have compassion and to have some respect.  
  
For a leader so nervous  
In an obvious way  
Stuttering and mumbling  
For nightly news to replay  
And the rest of the world  
Watching at the end of the day  
In the living room laughing  
Like what did he say?  
  
Amen, amen, amen, amen, amen  
  
In my living room watching,  
But I am not laughing.  
'Cause when it gets tense,  
I know what might happen.  
The world is cold,  
The bold men take action.  
Have to react,  
Or get blown into fractions.  
Ten years old is something to see,  
Another kid my age drugged under a jeep,  
Taken and bound and found later under a tree,  
I wonder if he thought the ""next one could be me"".  
Do you see?  
The soldiers they're out today.  
That brush the dust from bulletproof vests away.  
It's ironic,  
At times like this you pray,  
But a bomb blew the mosque up yesterday.  
There's bombs in the buses, bikes, roads,  
Inside your markets, your shops, your clothes,  
My dad, he's got a lot of fear I know  
But enough pride inside not to let that show.  
My brother had a book he would hold with pride  
A little red cover with a broken spine.  
In the back he hand wrote a quote inside,  
When the rich wage war, it's the poor who die.  
  
Meanwhile, the leader just talks away  
Stuttering and mumbling  
For nightly news to replay  
And the rest of the world  
Watching at the end of the day  
Both scared and angry  
Like what did he say?  
  
Amen, amen, amen, amen, amen.

Into a sky so blue  
As the ocean opens up  
To swallow you.  
  
With hands held high  
Into a sky so blue  
The ocean opens up  
To swallow you.  
  
With hands held high  
Into a sky so blue  
The ocean opens up  
To swallow you.  
  
With hands held high  
Into a sky so blue  
The ocean opens up  
To swallow you.  
  
With hands held high  
Into a sky so blue  
The ocean opens up  
To swallow you.  
  
With hands held high  
Into a sky so blue  
The ocean opens up  
To swallow you.

But trying to regain your trust was harder than it seemed  
And somehow I got caught up in between  
  
[Chorus]  
  
The only thing that's worse than one is none  
  
And I cannot explain to you  
In anything I say, or do, or plan  
Fear is not afraid of you  
Guilt's a language you can understand  
I cannot explain to you in anything I say or do  
I hope the actions speak the words they can  
  
For my pride and my promise  
For my lies and how the truth gets in the way  
The things I want to say to you get lost before they come  
The only thing that's worse than one is...  
For my pride and my promise  
Between my lies and how the truth gets in the way  
The things I want to say to you get lost before they come  
The only thing that's worse than one is none  
The only thing that's worse than one is none  
The only thing that's worse than one is none

Over basement tracks  
With raps that got you backing this up like (rewind that)

Rise from the ashes of stylistic division  
With these non-stop lyrics of life living  
Not to be forgotten  
But still unforgiven  
But in the meantime there are those who want to  
Talk this and that, so I suppose  
It gets to a point feelings gotta get hurt  
And get dirty with the people spreading the dirt

Heart full of pain, head full of stress  
Handful of anger, held in my chest  
And everything's left is a waste of time  
I hate my rhymes  
(But hate everyone else's more)  
I'm riding on the back of this pressure  
Guessing that it's better  
I can't keep myself together  
Because all of this stress  
Gave me something to write on  
The pain gave me something  
I could set my sights on  
You never forget the blood, sweat, and tears  
The uphill struggle over the years  
The fear and trash talking  
And the people it was to  
And the people that started it  
Just like you

Riding the wings of a song  
The fury is screaming and Heaven is falling  
I feel it coming on strong.  
  
The lightning strikes cracking the night  
It feels like never before  
Thunder and sparks in the heart of the dark  
I hear a rising force.  
  
Searching my soul I find something else  
I take my life in my hands  
From the gates of Heaven to the altars of Hell  
The power is at my command.  
  
The lightning strikes cracking the night  
I'm not the same anymore  
Thunder and spark in the heart of the dark  
I feel a rising force.  
  
Burned by the glory of a sacred fire  
A rising force starts to shine  
Alone in the inferno it soars ever higher  
Leaving the demons behind.

But darlin' when I hold you  
Don't you know I feel the same

And it's hard to hold a candle  
In the cold November rain  
  
We've been through this such a long long time  
Just tryin' to kill the pain, oo yeah  
But love is always coming and love is always going  
And no one's really sure who's lettin' go today  
Walking away  
  
If we could take the time  
To lay it on the line  
I could rest my head  
Just knowin' that you were mine  
All mine

Then darlin' don't refrain  
Or I'll just end up walkin'  
In the cold November rain  
  
Do you need some time on your own  
Do you need some time all alone  
Everybody needs some time  
On their own  
Don't you know you need some time all alone  
  
I know it's hard to keep an open heart  
When even friends seem out to harm you  
But if you could heal a broken heart  
Wouldn't time be out to charm you  
  
Sometimes I need some time on my  
Own  
Sometimes I need some time all alone  
Everybody needs some time  
On their own  
Don't you know you need some time all alone  
  
And when your fears subside  
And shadows still remain, oh yeah  
I know that you can love me  
When there's no one left to blame  
So never mind the darkness  
We still can find a way  
'Cause nothin' lasts forever  
Even cold November rain

Don't ya think that you need someone  
Everybody needs somebody

With a friendly voice  
A companion, unobtrusive  
Plays that song that's so elusive  
And the magic music makes your morning mood  
  
Off on your way  
Hit the open road  
There is magic at your fingers  
For the spirit ever lingers  
Undemanding contact  
In your happy solitude  
  
Invisible airwaves  
Crackle with life  
Bright antennae bristle  
With the energy  
Emotional feedback  
On a timeless wavelength  
Bearing a gift beyond price,  
Almost free  
  
All this machinery  
Making modern music  
Can still be open-hearted  
Not so coldly charted  
It's really just a question  
Of your honesty  
  
One likes to believe  
In the freedom of music  
But glittering prizes  
And endless compromises  
Shatter the illusion  
Of integrity  
  
For the words of the profits  
Were written on the studio wall,  
Concert hall,  
Echoes with the sounds, of salesmen

And history hides the lies of our civil wars  
  
D'you wear a black armband  
When they shot the man  
Who said ""peace could last forever""  
And in my first memories  
They shot Kennedy  
I went numb when I learned to see  
So I never fell for Vietnam

That you can't trust freedom  
When it's not in your hands  
When everybody's fightin'  
For their promised land  
And  
  
I don't need your civil war

Look at the blood we're spilling  
Look at the world we're killing  
The way we've always done before  
Look in the doubt we've wallowed  
Look at the leaders we've followed  
Look at the lies we've swallowed  
And I don't want to hear no more  
  
My hands are tied  
For all I've seen has changed my mind  
But still the wars go on as the years go by  
With no love of God or human rights  
'Cause all these dreams are swept aside  
By bloody hands of the hypnotized  
Who carry the cross of homicide  
And history bears the scars of our civil wars  
  
I don't need your civil war  
It feeds the rich while it buries the poor  
Your power hungry sellin' soldiers

Came to the world in the usual way  
But there were planes to catch and bills to pay  
He learned to walk while I was away  
He was talkin' 'fore I knew it

'I'm gonna be like you, Dad,  
You know I'm gonna be like you.'

And the cat's in the cradle and the silver spoon,  
Little boy blue and the man 'n the moon.  
'When you comin' home?'  
'Son, I don't know when. We'll get together then.  
You know we'll have a good time then.'  
  
Well, my son turned ten just the other day.  
He said, 'Thanks for the ball, Dad. Come on, let's play.  
Could you teach me to throw?'  
I said, 'Not today. I got a lot to do.'  
He said, 'That's okay.' And he walked away and he smiled and he said,  
'You know, I'm gonna be like him, yeah.  
You know I'm gonna be like him.'  
  
[Chorus]  
Well, he came from college just the other day,  
So much like a man I just had to say,  
'I'm proud of you. Could you sit for a while?'  
He shook his head and he said with a smile,  
'What I'd really like, Dad, is to borrow the car keys.  
See you later. Can I have them please ?'  
  
[Chorus]  
I've long since retired, my son's moved away.  
I called him up just the other day.  
'I'd like to see you, if you don't mind.'  
He said, 'I'd love to, Dad, if I could find the time.  
You see my new job's a hassle and the kids have the flu,  
But it's sure nice talkin' to you, Dad.  
It's been sure nice talkin' to you.'

He'd grown up just like me.

We made magic that night. Oh, he did everything right  
He brought the woman out of me, so many times, easily

I told him I am the flower you are the seed

Love like strangers  
All night long  
We made love  
  
Then it happened one day, we came round the same way  
You can imagine his surprise when he saw his own eyes

About a thing that I saw  
One night wandering in the everglades  
I'd one drink but no more  
  
I was rambling, enjoying the bright moonlight  
Gazing up at the stars  
Not aware of a presence so near to me  
Watching my every move  
  
Feeling scared and I fell to my knees  
As something rushed me from the trees  
Took me to an unholy place  
And that is where I fell from grace  
  
Then they summoned me over to join in with them  
To the dance of the dead  
Into the circle of fire I followed them  
Into the middle I was led  
  
As if time had stopped still I was numb with fear  
But still I wanted to go  
And the blaze of the fire did no hurt upon me  
As I walked onto the coals  
  
And I felt I was in a trance  
And my spirit was lifted from me  
And if only someone had the chance  
To witness what happened to me  
  
And I danced and I pranced and I sang with them  
All had death in their eyes  
Lifeless figures they were undead all of them  
They had ascended from hell  
  
As I danced with the dead  
My free spirit was laughing and howling down at me  
Below my undead body  
Just danced the circle of dead  
  
Until the time came to reunite us both  
My spirit came back down to me  
I didn't know if I was alive or dead  
As the others all joined in with me  
  
By luck then a skirmish started  
And took the attention away from me  
When they took their gaze from me  
Was the moment that I fled  
  
I ran like hell faster than the wind  
But behind I did not glance  
One thing that I did not dare  
Was to look just straight ahead  
  
When you know that your time has come around  
You know you'll be prepared for it  
Say your last goodbyes to everyone  
Drink and say a prayer for it  
  
When you're lying in your sleep, when you're lying in your bed  
And you wake from your dreams to go dancing with the dead  
When you're lying in your sleep, when you're lying in your bed  
And you wake from your dreams to go dancing with the dead  
  
To this day I guess I'll never know  
Just why they let me go  
But I'll never go dancing no more  
'Til I dance with the dead

I read the words that you sent to me  
I can take the afternoon, the night time comes around  
too soon  
You can't know what you mean to me  
  
Your poison letter, your telegram  
Just goes to show you don't give a damn

There in the darkness with the radio playing low  
And the secrets that we shared  
The mountains that we moved  
Caught like a wildfire out of control  
'Til there was nothing left to burn and nothing left to prove

Surrounded by strangers I thought were my friends  
I found myself further and further from my home  
And I guess I lost my way

I was living to run and running to live  
Never worryied about paying or even how much I owed  
Moving eight miles a minute for months at a time  
Breaking all of the rules that would bend  
I began to find myself searching  
Searching for shelter again and again

A little something against the wind  
I found myself seeking shelter sgainst the wind

What to leave in, what to leave out

You have no right to be the judge, to criticize and condemn.

But in their shame they're all the same, these men with broken hearts.  
Life sometimes can be so cruel that a heart will pray for death.

So help your brother along the road, no matter where he starts!

And bill was just a usual dad  
And they had their little family quarrels  
(Like everybody else)  
But neither one really got mad  
  
Then one day something happened  
It was nothing of course  
But one word led to another  
And the last word led to a divorce  
  
Now here were two grown up people  
Who failed to use common sense  
They strengthened their own selfish pride  
At little Sue's expense  
  
You know she didn't ask to be brought to  
This world  
To drift from pillar to post  
But a divorce never stops to consider  
The ones it hurts the most  
  
There'd be a lot more honest loving  
In this wicked ole world today  
If just a few parted parents  
Could hear little sue say  
  
Take me and lead me and hold to my hand  
Oh heavenly father, help me understand

To see my uncle Bill and sorta pass the time away  
I asked him how he'd been since last, I'd passed his way  
He rubbed his chin, here's what he had to say  
  
My wife's been sick, the young ones, too  
And I'm darn near down with the flu  
The cow's gone dry and them hens won't lay  
But we're still a-livin', so everything's okay  
  
The hogs took the cholera and they've all done died  
The bees got mad and they left the hive  
The weevils got the corn and the rain rotted the hay  
But we're still a-livin', so everything's okay  
  
The porch rotted down that's more expense  
The darned old mule he tore down the fence  
The mortgage is due and I can't pay  
But we're still a-livin', so everything's okay  
  
The cow broke in the field and eat up the beans  
The darn rabbits they got the turnip greens  
And my ma-in-law just moved in to stay  
But we're still a-livin', so everything's okay  
  
My land's so poor so hard and yeller  
You have to set on a sack of fertilizer to raise an umbreller  
And it rains out here nearly every day  
But we're still a-livin', so everything's okay  
  
The wells gone dry and I have to tote the water  
Up from the spring about a mile and a quarter  
My helper, he quit for the lack of pay  
But we're still a-livin', so everything's okay  
  
The house it leaks it needs a new top  
When it rains it wets everything we got  
The chimney fell down just yesterday  
But we're still a-livin', so everything's okay  
  
The corn meals gone and the meat's run out  
Got nothin' to kill to put in the smokehouse  
The preacher's comin' Sunday to spend the day  
But we're still a-livin', so everything's okay  
  
The canned stuffs spoiled else the jar's got broke  
And all we got left is one old Billy goat  
We're gonna have a new baby about the first of may  
But we're still a-livin', so everything's okay  
  
My crop it rotted in the ground  
I asked for another loan but the banker turned me down  
But we're still a-livin' and we're prayin' for better days  
So after all, everything's in pretty good shape

She's a makin' nauts, she's makin' time  
Just watch her swing and sway  
And from way out in the darkness  
See that headlight gleam  
It's the California Zephyr  
The Union Pacific Queen  
From the Great Salt Lakes of Utah  
To California's golden shore  
Colorado and Nevada  
Through the deserts burnin' door  
While she's circlin' through the canyons  
Can't you see that mountain stream  
It's the California Zephyr  
The Union Pacific Queen

Dan and I,

Cool, clear water.  
  
The nights are cool,  
And I'm a fool.  
Each stars a pool  
Of water.  
Cool, clear water.  
  
And with the dawn  
I'll wake and yawn  
And carry on  
To water.  
Cool, clear water.

And seem to say,  
""Tonight we pray  
For water.""

He'll hear our prayer  
And show us where  
There's water.  
Cool, clear water.  
  
Keep moving Dan.  
Don't you listen to him Dan.  
He's the devil not a man.  
He spreads the burning sands  
With Water.  
  
Say, Dan can't you see  
That big green tree  
Where the water's running free?  
It's waiting there for you and me.  
  
And water  
Cool, clear water.  
  
Dan's feet are sore.  
He's yearning for  
Just one thing more  
Than water.  
Cool, clear water.  
  
Like me I guess  
He'd like to rest  
Where there's no quest  
For water.  
Cool, clear water.

That you poured and didn't drink  
But at least you thought you wanted it

And as the door behind you closes

It's the first time that you haven't made the bed

There's so little left to say, we haven't said.

I find I haven't spoke a word

Of our one baby's cryin' goes unheard.

Hop in the sleigh,  
And we'll glide away into the night,  
And we'll sip on moonlight,  
Runny nose,  
My frosty toes are getting cold but I feel alive so I smile wide  
  
The snowflakes start falling and I start to float 'til my mean older brother
stuffs snow down my coat,

And I lie awake and miss you  
Pour me a heavy dose of atmosphere  
'Cause I'll doze off safe and soundly  
But I'll miss your arms around me  
I'd send a postcard to you, dear  
'Cause I wish you were here  
  
I'll watch the night turn light blue  
But it's not the same without you  
Because it takes two to whisper quietly  
The silence isn't so bad  
'Til I look at my hands and feel sad  
'Cause the spaces between my fingers  
Are right where yours fit perfectly  
  
I'll find repose in new ways  
Though I haven't slept in two days  
'Cause cold nostalgia chills me to the bone  
But drenched in vanilla twilight  
I'll sit on the front porch all night  
Waist deep in thought because when  
I think of you I don't feel so alone  
  
I don't feel so alone  
I don't feel so alone  
  
As many times as I blink  
I'll think of you tonight  
  
I'll think of you tonight  
  
When violet eyes get brighter  
And heavy wings grow lighter  
I'll taste the sky and feel alive again  
And I'll forget the world that I knew  
But I swear I won't forget you  
Oh if my voice could reach back through the past  
I'd whisper in your ear,  
""Oh darling I wish you were here""

Eh  
  
[Verse 1]  
It's a little blurry how the whole thing started  
I don't even really know what you intended  
Thought that you were cute and you could make me jealous  
Poured it down, so I poured it down  
Next thing that I know I'm in a hotel with you  
You were talking deep like it was mad love to you  
You wanted my heart but I just liked your tattoos  
Poured it down, so I poured it down  
  
[Pre-Chorus 1]  
And now I don't understand it  
You don't mess with love, you mess with the truth  
And I know I shouldn't say it  
But my heart don't understand  
  
[Chorus 1]  
Why I got you on my mind  
Why I got you on my mind  
Why I got you on my mind  
Why I got you on my mind  
But my heart don't understand  
Why I got you on my mind  
Why I got you on my mind  
Why I got you on my mind

[Verse 2]  
I always hear, always hear them talking  
Talking 'bout a girl, 'bout a girl with money  
Saying that I hurt you but I still don't get it  
You didn't love me, no, not really  
Wait  
I could have really liked you  
I'll bet, I'll bet that's why I keep on thinking 'bout you  
It's a shame (shame), you said I was good  
So I poured it down, so I poured it down  
  
[Pre-Chorus 1]  
And now I don't understand it  
You don't mess with love, you mess with the truth  
And I know I shouldn't say it  
But my heart don't understand  
  
[Chorus 2]  
Why I got you on my mind  
Why I got you on my mind  
Why I got you on my mind  
Why I got you on my mind  
But my heart don't understand  
Why I got you on my mind  
You think you know somebody  
Why I got you on my mind  
You think you know somebody  
Why I got you on my mind  
You think you know somebody  
Why I got you on my mi-i-i-i-ind  
  
[Bridge]  
You got yourself in a dangerous zone  
Cause we both have the fear, fear of being alone  
  
[Pre-Chorus 2]  
And I still don't understand it  
You don't mess with love, you mess with the truth  
And my heart don't understand it  
Understand it, understand it

One little angel who was riding a star  
Cried as she looked down at the tree,  
""Oh please Mr. Father Tree, wherever you are  
May I give him the star you gave to me?""  
Then in the heavens came a voice from afar  
A voice that was heard throughout the world,  
""Go down little angel girl and give him your star,  
Tonight he'll light the world!""

Waiting for someone to come by  
One little Christmas tree that never had grown  
Cried as he looked up to the sky,  
""Oh please Mr. Father Tree, the tallest of all,  
I'm so afraid and so alone.  
Could one little Christmas tree  
So tiny and small light up someone's home?""  
  
Cause one little Christmas tree can light up a home  
So one little child can find a toy.  
One little Christmas tree can light up a home  
So one little heart can find some joy.  
  
One little angel who was riding a star  
Cried as she looked down at the tree,  
""Oh please Mr. Father Tree, wherever you are  
May I give him the star you gave to me?""  
Then in the heavens came a voice from afar  
A voice that was heard throughout the world,  
""Go down little angel girl and give him your star,  
Tonight he'll light the world!""  
  
Cause one little Christmas tree  
Can light up the world  
So those who are lost may find their way.  
One little Christmas tree can light up the world  
So all men may see on Christmas day.

I got money matters weighing me down  
Oh the music may be merry, but it's only temporary  
I know Santa Claus is coming to town  
  
In the days I work my day job, in the nights I work my night  
But it all comes down to working man's pay  
Getting ready, I'm getting ready, ready for Christmas Day  
  
(Getting ready for Christmas Day  
And let me tell you, namely, the undertaker, he's getting ready for your body  
Not only that, the jailer he's getting ready for you  
Christmas Day. Hmm? And not only the jailer, but the lawyer, the police force  
Now getting ready for Christmas Day, and I want you to bear it in mind)  
  
I got a nephew in Iraq it's his third time back  
But it's ending up the way it began  
With the luck of a beginner he'll be eating turkey dinner  
On some mountain top in Pakistan  
  
Getting ready, oh we're getting ready  
For the power and the glory  
And the story of  
Christmas Day  
  
(Getting ready, for Christmas Day  
Done made it up in your mind that I'm going, New York, Philadelphia, Chicago  
I'm going, on a trip, getting ready, for Christmas Day  
But when Christmas come, nobody knows where you'll be  
You might ask me. I may be layin' in some lonesome grave  
Getting ready, for Christmas Day)  
  
Getting ready, oh we're getting ready  
For the power and the glory and the story of the  
Christmas Day  
Yes, we're getting ready  
  
(Getting ready, ready for your prayers,  
""I'm going and see my relatives in a distant land""  
Getting ready, getting ready for Christmas Day)  
  
If I could tell my Mom and Dad that the things we never had  
Never mattered we were always okay  
Getting ready, oh ready, ready for Christmas Day  
Ready, getting ready  
For the power and the glory and the story of the  
Christmas Day

My words are all carried away  
I talk to the wind  
The wind does not hear  
The wind cannot hear.  
  
I'm on the outside looking inside  
What do I see  
Much confusion, disillusion  
All around me.  
  
You don't possess me  
Don't impress me  
Just upset my mind  
Can't instruct me or conduct me  
Just use up my time  
  
I talk to the wind  
My words are all carried away  
I talk to the wind  
The wind does not hear  
The wind cannot hear.

On a cloudy day  
In fields where the yellow grass grows knee-high  
So won't you try to come  
  
Come away with me and we'll kiss  
On a mountaintop  
Come away with me  
And I'll never stop loving you

Falling on a tin roof  
While I'm safe there in your arms

To come away with me in the night  
Come away with me

Leaving me a song that will not die

The music of the years gone by

The lonely night dreaming of a song  
The melody haunts my reverie  
And I am once again with you  
When our love was new  
And each kiss an inspiration  
But that was long ago  
Now my consolation  
Is in the stardust of a song  
  
Beside a garden wall  
When stars are bright  
You are in my arms  
The nightingale tells his fairy tale  
A paradise where roses bloom  
Though I dream in vain  
In my heart it will remain  
My stardust melody  
The memory of love's refrain

So fast  
  
It was good  
It was bad,  
But it was real  
And that's all you have  
In the end our love mattered  
  
If you feel like leaving  
I'm not going to make you stay  
But soon you'll be finding  
You can run

You can run  
You can hide

At least you can predict this every year

I can't get it to speak  
Maybe if I knew all the things it took to save us  
I could fix the pain that bleeds inside of me  
Look in your eyes to see something about me  
I'm standing on the edge and I don't know what else to give

How can I love you?  
How can I love you?  
How can I love you?

It flows through my head  
The question is she needed  
And decide all the man I can ever be.  
Looking at the last 3 years like I did,  
I could never see us ending like this (Do you know?)  
Seeing your face no more on my pillow  
Is a scene that's never ever happened to me (Do you know?)  
But after this episode I don't see  
You could never tell the next thing life could be

and now you're swimming for the shore.  
You left me drowning in my tears,

And you control how fast we go by just how hard you wanna squeeze  
It's hard to steer when you're breathing in my ear  
But I got both hands on the wheel while you got both hands on my gears  
By now, no doubt that we were heading south

When she whispered ""what was that?""  
The wind, I think 'cause no one else knows where we are  
And that was when she started screamin'  
""That's my dad outside the car!""  
Oh please, the keys, they're not in the ignition  
Must have wound up on the floor while  
we were switching our positions  
I guess they knew that she was missing  
As I tried to tell her dad it was her mouth that I was kissing

Control of population everybody's been there and  
I don't mean on vacation  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Destruction leads to a very rough road  
But it also breeds creation  
And earthquakes are to a girl's guitar  
They're just another good vibration  
And tidal waves couldn't save the world  
From Californication  
  
Pay your surgeon very well  
To break the spell of aging  
Sicker than the rest  
There is no test  
But this is what you're craving  
  
[Chorus]

Splashing through the sand bar  
Talking by the campfire

We didn't have no internet  
But man I never will forget  
The way the moonlight shined upon her hair

We were smoking funny things  
Making love out by the lake to our favorite song  
Sipping whiskey out the bottle, not thinking 'bout tomorrow  
Singing Sweet home Alabama all summer long  
Singing Sweet home Alabama all summer long  
  
Catching Walleye from the dock  
Watching the waves roll off the rocks  
She'll forever hold a spot inside my soul

We couldn't wait for night to come  
To hit that sand and play some rock and roll

Sipping whiskey out the bottle, not thinking 'bout tomorrow

Now nothing seems as strange as when the leaves began to change  
Or how we thought those days would never end  
Sometimes I'll hear that song and I'll start to sing along  
And think man I'd love to see that girl again

French kiss the morning

That each step that I take is on my way home

Just to see through this payphone  
Still I run out of time  
Or it's hard to get through  
Till the bird on the wire flies me back to you  
I'll just close my eyes and whisper,

Know I'll be thinking about you  
While my mistress she calls me  
To stand in her spotlight again

I've made mistakes, I'm just a man  
  
When he holds you close, when he pulls you near  
When he says the words  
You've been needing to hear, I'll wish I was him  
'Cause these words are mine, to say to you  
'Til the end of time  
  
Yeah I, will love you, baby  
Always and I'll be there  
Forever and a day, always  
  
If you told me to cry for you, I could  
If you told me to die for you, I would  
Take a look at my face  
There's no price I won't pay  
To say these words to you  
  
Well, there ain't no luck in these loaded dice  
But baby, if you give me just one more try  
We can pack up our old dreams, and our old lives,  
We'll find a place, where the sun still shines  
  
Yeah I, will love you, baby  
Always and I'll be there  
Forever and a day, always  
  
I'll be there, till the stars don't shine  
'Til the heavens burst and the words don't rhyme  
I know when I die you'll be on my mind  
And I'll love you, always  
Always

But then it slipped away  
Standing at the end of the final masquerade

Think I'll lose my mind if I don't find something to pacify  
  
Can you help me occupy my brain?  
Oh yeah  
  
I need someone to show me the things in life that I can't find  
I can't see the things that make true happiness, I must be blind  
  
Make a joke and I will sigh and you will laugh and I will cry  
Happiness I cannot feel and love to me us so unreal  
  
And so as you hear these words telling you now of my state  
I tell you to enjoy life I wish I could but it's too late

Heard a scream, saw him fall, no one cried

Is there a Heaven in the sky

We all walk under the same moon  
Then why, why can't we live as one

Fading shadows one by one  
We watch the lamb, lay down to the sacrifice  
I saw the children

We're loosing all we had and no one seems to care  
But in my heart it doesn't change  
We've got to rearrange and bring our world some love  
  
And does it really matter  
If there's a heaven up above  
We sure could use some love

For something untouched  
Hearing voices of the never-fading calling

But then if you're so smart, then tell me  
Why are you still so afraid?  
  
Where's the fire, what's the hurry about?  
You'd better cool it off before you burn it out  
You've got so much to do  
And only so many hours in a day  
  
But you know that when the truth is told  
That you can get what you want or you get old  
You're gonna kick off before you even  
Get halfway through  
When will you realize, Vienna waits for you  
  
Slow down, you're doing fine  
You can't be everything you want to be  
Before your time  
Although it's so romantic on the borderline tonight  
Tonight,  
Too bad but it's the life you lead  
You're so ahead of yourself that you forgot what you need  
Though you can see when you're wrong, you know  
You can't always see when you're right. you're right  
  
You've got your passion, you've got your pride  
But don't you know that only fools are satisfied?  
Dream on, but don't imagine they'll all come true  
When will you realize, Vienna waits for you?  
  
Slow down, you crazy child  
And take the phone off the hook and disappear for awhile  
It's all right, you can afford to lose a day or two  
When will you realize, Vienna waits for you?  
And you know that when the truth is told

I'm that voice you're hearing in the hall  
And the greatest miracle of all  
Is how I need you  
And how you needed me too  
That hasn't happened for the longest time  
  
Maybe this won't last very long  
But you feel so right  
And I could be wrong  
Maybe I've been hoping too hard  
But I've gone this far  
And it's more than I hoped for  
  
Who knows how much further we'll go on  
Maybe I'll be sorry when you're gone  
I'll take my chances  
I forgot how nice romance is  
I haven't been there for the longest time  
  
I had second thoughts at the start  
I said to myself  
Hold on to your heart  
Now I know the woman that you are  
You're wonderful so far  
And it's more than I hoped for  
  
I don't care what consequence it brings  
I have been a fool for lesser things  
I want you so bad  
I think you ought to know that  
I intend to hold you for the longest time

Now Paul is a real estate novelist  
Who never had time for a wife  
And he's talkin' with Davy, who's still in the Navy  
And probably will be for life  
  
And the waitress is practicing politics  
As the businessmen slowly get stoned  
Yes, they're sharing a drink they call loneliness  
But it's better than drinkin' alone  
  
Sing us a song you're the piano man  
Sing us a song tonight  
Well we're all in the mood for a melody  
And you got us feeling alright  
  
It's a pretty good crowd for a Saturday  
And the manager gives me a smile  
'Cause he knows that it's me they've been comin' to see  
To forget about life for a while  
And the piano, it sounds like a carnival  
And the microphone smells like a beer  
And they sit at the bar and put bread in my jar  
And say, ""Man, what are you doin' here?""  
  
Oh, la la la, di da da

Sing us a song you're the piano man  
Sing us a song tonight

And you've early closed your curtains,  
I'll wait by the backstage door

The lines to speak your mind  
And pry it open, hoping for a encore  
And if it gets too late, for me to wait  
For you to find you love me, and tell me so  
It's ok, don't need to say it

You're getting a bad reputation in your neighborhood  
It's alright  
It's alright  
Sometimes that's what it takes  
You're only human  
You're allowed to make your share of mistakes  
You better believe there will be times in your life  
When you'll be feeling like a stumbling fool  
So take it from me you'll learn more from your accidents  
Than anything that you could ever learn at school  
Don't forget your second wind  
Sooner of later you'll get your second wind  
It's not always easy to be living in this world of pain  
You're gonna be crashing into stone walls again and again  
It's alright  
It's alright  
Though you feel your heart break  
You're only human  
You're gonna have to deal with heartache  
Just like a boxer in a title fight  
You got to walk in that ring all alone  
You're not the only one who's made mistakes  
But they're the only thing that you can truly call your own  
Don't forget your second wind  
Wait in that corner until that breeze blows in  
You've been keeping to yourself these days  
Cause you're thinking everything's gone wrong  
Sometimes you just want to lay down and die  
That emotion can be so strong  
But hold on  
Till that old second wind comes along  
You probably don't want to hear advice from someone else  
But I wouldn't be telling you if I hadn't been there myself  
It's alright  
It's alright  
Sometimes that's all it takes  
We're only human  
We're supposed to make mistakes  
But I survived all those long lonely days  
When it seemed I did not have a friend  
Cause all I needed was a little faith  
So I could catch my breath and face the world again  
Don't forget your second wind  
Sooner or later you'll feel that momentum kick in  
Don't forget your second wind  
Sooner or later you'll feel that momentum kick in

You gotta go and get angry at all of my honesty,  
You know I try but I don't do too well with apologies.  
I hope I don't run out of time, could someone call a referee?  
Cause I just need one more shot at forgiveness.  
I know you know that I made those mistakes maybe once or twice,  
By once or twice I mean maybe a couple a hundred times.  
So let me, oh let me redeem, oh redeem, oh myself tonight,

[Verse 2]  
I'll take every single piece of the blame if you want me to,  
But you know that there is no innocent one in this game for two.  
I'll go, I'll go and then you go, you go out and spill the truth,  
Can we both say the words and forget this?

Colors and promises  
How to be brave  
How can I love when I'm afraid to fall  
But watching you stand alone  
All of my doubt, suddenly goes away somehow  
  
One step closer  
  
I have died everyday, waiting for you  
Darling, don't be afraid, I have loved you for a thousand years  
I'll love you for a thousand more  
  
Time stands still  
Beauty in all she is  
I will be brave  
I will not let anything, take away  
What's standing in front of me  
Every breath, every hour has come to this  
  
One step closer  
  
I have died everyday, waiting for you  
Darling, don't be afraid, I have loved you for a thousand years  
I'll love you for a thousand more  
  
And all along I believed, I would find you  
Time has brought your heart to me, I have loved you for a thousand years

He could be a silence in this mayhem, but then again  
He'll never love you like I can, can, can  
  
[Chorus]  
Why are you looking down all the wrong roads  
When mine is the heart, with the soul for your soul  
There may be lovers who hold out their hands but  
He'll never love you like I can, can, can  
He'll never love you like I can, can, can  
He'll never love you like I can, can, can  
  
[Bridge]  
We both have demons, that we can't stand  
I love your demons, like devils can  
If you're still seeking an honest man  
Then stop deceiving lord please  
  
[Chorus]  
Why are you looking down all the wrong roads  
When mine is the heart, with the soul for your soul  
There may be lovers who hold out their hands but  
He'll never love you like I can, can, can

You're the best way I know to escape the extraordinary

And everybody that's around they know that I'm not myself when you gone  
It's good to see you again, good to see you again  
On top of the world, is where I stand when you're back in my life

Loving can hurt, loving can hurt sometimes.  
But it's the only thing that I know.  
When it gets hard, you know it can get hard sometimes,  
It is the only thing that makes us feel alive.  
  
[Pre-Chorus]  
We keep this love in a photograph.  
We made these memories for ourselves.  
Where our eyes are never closing,  
Our hearts are never broken,  
And time's forever frozen, still.  
  
[Chorus]  
So you can keep me  
Inside the pocket of your ripped jeans.  
Holding me close until our eyes meet.  
You won't ever be alone, wait for me to come home.  
  
[Verse 2]  
Loving can heal, loving can mend your soul,  
And it's the only thing that I know, know.  
I swear it will get easier, remember that with every piece of 'ya,  
And it's the only thing we take with us when we die.  
  
[Pre-Chorus]  
We keep this love in a photograph.  
We made these memories for ourselves.  
Where our eyes are never closing,

So you can keep me  
Inside the pocket of your ripped jeans.  
Holding me close until our eyes meet.  
You won't ever be alone,  
And if you hurt me,  
That's okay baby, only words bleed.  
Inside these pages you just hold me,  
And I won't ever let you go.  
Wait for me to come home,  
Wait for me to come home,  
Wait for me to come home,  
Wait for me to come home.  
  
[Bridge]  
You can fit me  
Inside the necklace you got when you were sixteen.  
Next to your heartbeat where I should be.  
Keep it deep within your soul.  
And if you hurt me  
Well that's okay baby, only words bleed.  
Inside these pages you just hold me,  
And I won't ever let you go.

When I'm away, I will remember how you kissed me  
Under the lamppost back on Sixth street,  
Hearing you whisper through the phone,  
Wait for me to come home.

I feel so alone on a Friday night  
Can you make me feel like home if I tell you you're mine

So choose your last words, this is the last time  
Cause you and I, we were born to die  
  
Lost but now I am found  
I can see but once I was blind  
I was so confused as a little child  
Tried to take what I could get  
Scared that I couldn't find  
All the answers honey

I close my eyes and the flashback starts  
I'm standing there on a balcony in summer air  
  
See the lights, see the party, the ball gowns  
See you make your way through the crowd  
And say hello  
  
Little did I know  
That you were Romeo, you were throwing pebbles  
And my daddy said, ""Stay away from Juliet""  
And I was crying on the staircase  
Begging you, please, don't go  
  
And I said,  
""Romeo, take me somewhere we can be alone  
I'll be waiting, all that's left to do is run  
You'll be the prince and I'll be the princess  
It's a love story, baby just say yes  
  
So I sneak out to the garden to see you  
We keep quiet 'cause we're dead if they knew  
So close your eyes, escape this town for a little while  
'Cause you were Romeo, I was a scarlet letter  
And my daddy said ""Stay away from Juliet""  
But you were everything to me, I was begging you, please, don't go  
  
And I said Romeo take me somewhere we can be alone  
I'll be waiting, all there's left to do is run  
You'll be the prince and I'll be the princess  
It's a love story baby just say yes  
  
Romeo save me, they're trying to tell me how to feel  
This love is difficult, but it's real  
Don't be afraid, we'll make it out of this mess  
It's a love story, baby just say ""Yes""  
  
Oh, oh  
  
I got tired of waiting  
Wondering if you were ever coming around  
My faith in you was fading  
When I met you on the outskirts of town  
  
And I said  
""Romeo save me, I've been feeling so alone  
I keep waiting for you but you never come  
Is this in my head? I don't know what to think""  
  
He knelt to the ground and pulled out a ring and said  
""Marry me, Juliet, you'll never have to be alone  
I love you and that's all I really know  
I talked to your dad, go pick out a white dress  
It's a love story, baby just say yes""  
  
Oh, oh,  
Oh, oh  
  
'Cause we were both young when I first saw you.

With me and the girl from Clapham  
Out on the windy common  
That night I ain't forgotten  
When she dealt out the rations  
With some or other passions  
I said ""you are a lady""  
""Perhaps"" she said. ""I may be""  
  
We moved in to a basement  
With thoughts of our engagement  
We stayed in by the telly  
Although the room was smelly  
We spent our time just kissing  
The Railway Arms we're missing  
But love had got us hooked up  
And all our time it took up  
  
I got a job with Stanley  
He said I'd come in handy  
And started me on Monday  
So I had a bath on Sunday  
I worked eleven hours  
And bought the girl some flowers  
She said she'd seen a doctor  
And nothing now could stop her  
  
I worked all through the winter  
The weather brass and bitter  
I put away a tenner  
Each week to make her better  
And when the time was ready  
We had to sell the telly  
Late evenings by the fire  
With little kicks inside her  
  
This morning at four fifty  
I took her rather nifty  
Down to an incubator  
Where thirty minutes later  
She gave birth to a daughter  
Within a year a walker  
She looked just like her mother  
If there could be another  
  
And now she's two years older  
Her mother's with a soldier  
She left me when my drinking  
Became a proper stinging  
The devil came and took me  
From bar to street to bookie  
No more nights by the telly  
No more nights nappies smelling  
  
Alone here in the kitchen  
I feel there's something missing  
I'd beg for some forgiveness  
But begging's not my business  
And she won't write a letter  
Although I always tell her  
And so it's my assumption

With me and the girl from Clapham  
Out on the windy common  
That night I ain't forgotten  
When she dealt out the rations  
With some or other passions  
I said ""you are a lady""  
""Perhaps"" she said. ""I may be""  
  
We moved in to a basement  
With thoughts of our engagement  
We stayed in by the telly  
Although the room was smelly  
We spent our time just kissing  
The Railway Arms we're missing  
But love had got us hooked up  
And all our time it took up  
  
I got a job with Stanley  
He said I'd come in handy  
And started me on Monday  
So I had a bath on Sunday  
I worked eleven hours  
And bought the girl some flowers  
She said she'd seen a doctor  
And nothing now could stop her  
  
I worked all through the winter  
The weather brass and bitter  
I put away a tenner  
Each week to make her better  
And when the time was ready  
We had to sell the telly  
Late evenings by the fire  
With little kicks inside her  
  
This morning at four fifty  
I took her rather nifty  
Down to an incubator  
Where thirty minutes later  
She gave birth to a daughter  
Within a year a walker  
She looked just like her mother  
If there could be another  
  
And now she's two years older  
Her mother's with a soldier  
She left me when my drinking  
Became a proper stinging  
The devil came and took me  
From bar to street to bookie  
No more nights by the telly  
No more nights nappies smelling  
  
Alone here in the kitchen  
I feel there's something missing  
I'd beg for some forgiveness  
But begging's not my business  
And she won't write a letter  
Although I always tell her  
And so it's my assumption  
I'm really up the junction

Sunlight on the lino  
Woke me with a shake  
I looked around to find her but she'd gone  
Goodbye girl  
Goodbye girl  
Goodbye girl  
  
She took me to a motel  
A room on the second floor  
A kettle and two coffees  
A number on the door  
She said I hardly know you  
Agreed we kissed goodnight  
I knew that in the morning  
Somehow I'd wake to find  
  
Sunlight on the lino  
Wakening me with a shake  
I looked around to find her but she'd gone  
Goodbye girl  
Goodbye girl  
Goodbye girl  
  
I lost my silver razor  
My clubroom locker keys  
The money in the waistcoat  
It doesn't bother me  
My wife has moved to Jersey  
So mud is not the word  
If you ever see her  
Say hello goodbye girl

Woke me with a shake

Goodbye girl

She sits in a towel with a purple hair dryer,  
She waits to get even with me.  
She hooks up her cupcakes and puts on her jumper  
Explains that she'll be late to a worrying mother,  
She meets me in Piccadilly.  
A begging folk singer stands tall by the entrance  
His song relays worlds of most good intentions,  
A fiver a ten p in his hat for collection.  
  
She talks about office she talks about dresses  
She's seen one she fancies her smile is impressing,  
So maybe I'll treat her someday.  
We queue among strangers and strange conversation  
Love's on the lips of all forms of engagements,  
All queuing to see tonight's play.  
  
A man behind me talks to his young lady  
He's happy that she is expecting his baby,  
His wife won't be pleased but she's not been round lately.  
  
The girl was so dreadful we left in a hurry  
We escaped in the rain for an Indian curry,  
At the candle lit Taj Mahal.  
My lips to a napkin I called for a taxi  
The invite of eyes made it tense but relaxed me,  
My mind took a devious role.  
  
The cab took us home through a night I'd not noticed  
The neon club lights of adult films and Trini Lopez,  
My arm around love but my acting was hopeless.  
  
We crept like two thieves from the kettle to the fire  
We kissed to the sound of the silence that we'd hired,  
Now captured, your love in my arms.  
A door opened slightly a voice spoke in worry  
Mum went to bed without wind of the curry,  
Our secret love made its advance.  
  
Like Adam and Eve we took bite on the apple  
Loose change in my pocket it started to rattle,  
Heart like a gun was just half of the battle.

I think I'd be good for you and you'd be good for me  
  
I asked you to go to the Green Day concert  
You said you never heard of them  
How cool is that?  
So I went to your room and read your diary:  
""watching Grunge leg-drop New-Jack trough presstable...""  
And then my heart stopped:  
""Listening to Cio-Cio San fall in love all over again.""  
  
How stupid is it? I can't talk about it  
I gotta sing about it and make a record of my heart  
How stupid is it? won't you gimme a minute  
Just come up to me and say ""hello"" to my heart  
How stupid is it? For all I know you want me too  
And maybe you just don't know what to do  
Or maybe you're scared to say: ""I'm falling for you""  
  
I wish I could get my head out of the sand  
'Cause I think we'd make a good team  
And you would keep my fingernails clean  
But that's just a stupid dream that I won't realize  
'Cause I can't even look in your eyes without shakin', and I ain't fakin'  
I'll bring home the turkey if you bring home the bacon

Do they still meet there by the Cut

Leaving the myriad small creatures trying to tie us to the ground  
To a life consumed by slow decay

The light was brighter

Dragged by the force of some inner tide  
At a higher altitude with flag unfurled

You gotta sleep on your toes, and when you're on the street,  
You gotta be able to pick out the easy meat with your eyes closed.  
And then moving in silently, down wind and out of sight,  
You gotta strike when the moment is right without thinking.  
  
And after a while, you can work on points for style.  
Like the club tie, and the firm handshake,  
A certain look in the eye and an easy smile.  
You have to be trusted by the people that you lie to,  
So that when they turn their backs on you,  
You'll get the chance to put the knife in.  
  
You gotta keep one eye looking over your shoulder.  
You know it's going to get harder, and harder, and harder as you get older.  
And in the end you'll pack up and fly down south,  
Hide your head in the sand,  
Just another sad old man,  
All alone and dying of cancer.  
  
And when you loose control, you'll reap the harvest you have sown.  
And as the fear grows, the bad blood slows and turns to stone.  
And it's too late to lose the weight you used to need to throw around.  
So have a good drown, as you go down, all alone,  
Dragged down by the stone.  
  
I gotta admit that I'm a little bit confused.  
Sometimes it seems to me as if I'm just being used.  
Gotta stay awake, gotta try and shake off this creeping malaise.  
If I don't stand my own ground, how can I find my way out of this maze?  
  
Deaf, dumb, and blind, you just keep on pretending  
That everyone's expendable and no-one has a real friend.  
And it seems to you the thing to do would be to isolate the winner  
And everything's done under the sun,  
And you believe at heart, everyone's a killer.

Who was broken by trained personnel.  
  
Who was fitted with collar and chain.  
Who was given a pat on the back  
Who was breaking away from the pack.  
Who was only a stranger at home.  
  
Who was ground down in the end.  
Who was found dead on the phone.

Will you still hold me tonight?

Would you sell your story to Rolling Stone?  
Would you take the children away  
And leave me alone?  
And smile in reassurance  
As you whisper down the phone?  
Would you send me packing?  
Or would you take me home?

Thought I oughta tear the curtain down.

I'll come home.

By a country style  
And listen to the things they say.  
Diggin' for gold  
With a hoe in my hand.  
Open a book  
Take a look at the way things stand.  
  
And you're leading me down  
To the place by the sea.  
I hear your soft voice  
Calling to me.  
Making a date for  
Later by phone

I'll come home.

The living soul of  
  
Oh, my, something in my eye, eye  
Something in the sky, sky  
Waiting there for me  
  
The outer lock rolled slowly back  
The service men were heard to sigh  
For there revealed in glowing robes  
Was Lucy in the sky  
  
Oh, oh, did you ever know, know  
Never ever will they  
I cannot say  
  
Something in his cosmic art  
And glowing slightly from his toes  
The psychic and the nations fly

Her long hair flowing in the mid-winter wind.  
I know not how she found me, for in darkness I was walking,  
And destruction lay around me from a fight I could not win.  
  
She asked me name my foe then. I said the need within some men  
To fight and kill their brothers without thought of love or god.  
And I begged her give me horses to trample down my enemies,  
So eager was my passion to devour this waste of life.  
  
But she would not think of battle that reduces men to animals,  
So easy to begin and yet impossible to end.  
For she the mother of all men had counseled me so wisely that  
I feared to walk alone again and asked if she would stay.  
  
""Oh lady lend your hand,"" I cried, ""Oh let me rest here at your side.""  
""Have faith and trust in me,"" she said and filled my heart with life.  
There is no strength in numbers. I've no such misconceptions.  
But when you need me be assured I won't be far away.  
  
Thus having spoke she turned away and though I found no words to say  
I stood and watched until I saw her black cloak disappear.  
My labor is no easier, but now I know I'm not alone.  
I find new heart each time I think upon that windy day.  
And if one day she comes to you drink deeply from her words so wise.  
Take courage from her as your prize and say hello for me.

Your exquisite wife and mother,  
Fills me with the urge to defecate!

Cause it's the one we'll never know  
And quit running for that runaway bus  
Cause those rosy days are few  
And, stop apologizing for the things you've never done,  
Cause time is short and life is cruel  
But it's up to us to change  
This town called malice.  
Rows and rows of disused milk floats  
Stand dying in the dairy yard  
And a hundred lonely housewives clutch empty milk  
Bottles to their hearts  
Hanging out their old love letters on the line to dry  
It's enough to make you stop believing when tears come  
Fast and furious  
In a town called malice.  
  
Struggle after struggle, year after year  
The atmosphere's a fine blend of ice  
I'm almost stone cold dead  
In a town called malice.  
  
A whole street's belief in Sunday's roast beef  
Gets dashed against the Co-op  
To either cut down on beer or the kids new gear  
It's a big decision in a town called malice.  
  
The ghost of a steam train, echoes down my track  
It's at the moment bound for nowhere  
Just going round and round  
Playground kids and creaking swings  
Lost laughter in the breeze  
I could go on for hours and I probably will  
But I'd sooner put some joy back  
In this town called malice.

Light me up that cigarette and I strap shoes on my feet  
Got to find a reason, a reason things went wrong  
Got to find a reason why my money's all gone  
I got a dalmatian, and I can still get high  
I can play the guitar like a motherfucking riot  
  
Well, life is too short, so love the one you got  
'Cause you might get run over or you might get shot  
Never start static I just get it off my chest  
Never had to battle with no bulletproof vest  
Take a small example, take a tip from me  
Take all of your money, give it all to charity  
  
Love is what I got  
Within my reach  
And the Sublime style's still straight from Long Beach  
It all comes back to you, you'll finally get what you deserve  
Try and test that you're bound to get served  
  
Love's what I got  
Don't start a riot  
You'll feel it when the dance gets hot

Lovin', is what I got, I said remember that

I don't get angry at the bills I have to pay  
I don't get angry when my Mom smokes pot  
Hits the bottle and goes right to the rock  
Fuckin' and fightin', it's all the same  
Livin' with Louie dog's the only way to stay sane  
Let the lovin', let the lovin' come back to me

The ghost of a steam train, echoes down my track  
It's at the moment bound for nowhere

Playground kids and creaking swings  
Lost laughter in the breeze  
I could go on for hours and I probably will  
But I'd sooner put some joy back  
In this town called malice.

I'm like a mother barely keeping it together

Are you scared to death to live?  
I been running all my life  
Just to find a home that's for the restless  
And the truth that's in the message  
Making my way, away, away

Way back up in the woods among the evergreens  
There stood a log cabin made of earth and wood  
Where lived a country boy named Johnny B. Goode  
Who never ever learned to read or write so well  
But he could play the guitar just like a ringing a bell  
  
Go go  
Go Johnny go  
Go  
Go Johnny go  
Go  
Go Johnny go  
Go  
Go Johnny go  
Go  
Johnny B. Goode  
  
He used to carry his guitar in a gunny sack  
Go sit beneath the tree by the railroad track  
Oh, the engineers would see him sitting in the shade  
Strumming with the rhythm that the drivers made  
People passing by they would stop and say  
Oh my that little country boy could play  
  
Go go  
Go Johnny go  
Go  
Go Johnny go  
Go  
Go Johnny go  
Go

His mother told him ""Someday you will be a man,  
And you will be the leader of a big old band.  
Many people coming from miles around

Tiptoes to my room every night  
Just to sprinkle star dust and to whisper  
""Go to sleep, everything is alright""  
  
I close my eyes then I drift away  
Into the magic night, I softly say  
A silent prayer like dreamers do  
Then I fall asleep to dream my dreams of you  
  
In dreams I walk with you  
In dreams I talk to you  
In dreams you're mine all the time  
We're together in dreams, in dreams  
  
But just before the dawn  
I awake and find you gone  
I can't help it, I can't help it if I cry  
I remember that you said goodbye  
  
It's too bad it only seems  
It only happens in my dreams  
Only in dreams  
In beautiful dreams.

I'm on top of the world  
  
I've tried to cut these corners  
Try to take the easy way out  
I kept on falling short of something  
  
I coulda gave up then but  
Then again I couldn't have 'cause  
I've traveled all this way for something  
  
Now take it in but don't look down  
  
'Cause I'm on top of the world, 'ey  
I'm on top of the world, 'ey  
Waiting on this for a while now  
Paying my dues to the dirt  
I've been waiting to smile, 'ey  
Been holding it in for a while, 'ey  
Take it with me if I can  
Been dreaming of this since a child  
I'm on top of the world  
  
'Cause I'm on top of the world, 'ey  
I'm on top of the world, 'ey  
Waiting on this for a while now  
Paying my dues to the dirt  
I've been waiting to smile, 'ey  
Been holding it in for a while, 'ey  
Take it with me if I can  
Been dreaming of this since a child  
  
And I know it's hard when you're falling down  
And it's a long way up when you hit the ground  
Get up now, get up, get up now  
  
And I know it's hard when you're falling down  
And it's a long way up when you hit the ground  
Get up now, get up, get up now  
  
'Cause I'm on top of the world, 'ey  
I'm on top of the world, 'ey  
Waiting on this for a while now  
Paying my dues to the dirt  
I've been waiting to smile, 'ey

And CK eternity, oh hell yes.  
Divide me down to the smallest I can be,  
Put your, put your v-v-v-venom in me.

Would fall for her incognito.  
And when he laid eyes on her,  
He got the feeling they had met before.  
Uncanny how she  
Reminds him of his little lady,  
Capacity to give him all he needs,  
Just like his wife before she freezed on him,  
Just like his wife when she was beautiful.  
He shouted out, ""I'm  
  
All yours,  
Babooshka, Babooshka, Babooshka-ya-ya!

Fall on your knees, oh hear the angel voices  
Oh night divine, oh night when Christ was born  
Oh night, oh holy night, oh night divine  
  
Truly He taught us to love one another  
His law is love and His gospel is peace  
Chains shall He break for the slave is our brother  
And in His name all oppression shall cease  
  
Sweet hymns of joy in grateful chorus raise we  
Let all within us praise His holy name  
Christ is the Lord, oh praise His name forever  
His power and glory ever more proclaim  
His power and glory ever more proclaim  
  
Oh night divine, oh night when Christ was born  
Oh night, oh holy night, oh night divine

And I will find a way to you if it kills me

Wishing to kiss you,  
Before I rightly explode?

Baby there's a lot that I miss  
In case I'm wrong

I'd ask you to hold my heart in your hand  
Tell you from the start how I've longed to be your man  
But I never said a word  
I guess I'm gonna miss my chance again

Drunk and dressed in their best brown baggies and their platform soles

I don't mean on vacation  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Destruction leads to a very rough road  
But it also breeds creation  
And earthquakes are to a girl's guitar  
They're just another good vibration  
And tidal waves couldn't save the world  
From Californication  
  
Pay your surgeon very well  
To break the spell of aging  
Sicker than the rest  
There is no test  
But this is what you're craving  
  
[Chorus]

Some try to hand me money they don't understand,  
I'm not, broke I'm just a broken hearted man,

How can I move on when I'm still in love with you  
  
'Cause if one day you wake up and find that you're missing me,

Who's waiting on a girl  
  
There are no holes in his shoes  
But a big hole in his world  
  
And maybe I'll get famous as man who can't be moved,  
And maybe you won't mean to but you'll see me on the news,  
And you'll come running to the corner  
'Cause you'll know it's just for you  
  
I'm the man who can't be moved

Maybe this year will be better than the last  
I can't remember the last thing that you said as you were leavin'  
Now the days go by so fast  
  
And it's one more day up in the canyons  
And it's one more night in Hollywood  
If you think that I could be forgiven I wish you would  
  
The smell of hospitals in winter  
And the feeling that it's all a lot of oysters, but no pearls  
All at once you look across a crowded room  
To see the way that light attaches to a girl  
  
And it's one more day up in the canyons  
And it's one more night in Hollywood  
If you think you might come to California I think you should  
  
Drove up to Hillside Manor sometime after two a.m.  
And talked a little while about the year  
I guess the winter makes you laugh a little slower,  
Makes you talk a little lower about the things you could not show her  
  
And it's been a long December and there's reason to believe  
Maybe this year will be better than the last  
I can't remember all the times I tried to tell my myself  
To hold on to these moments as they pass  
  
And it's one more day up in the canyon  
And it's one more night in Hollywood  
It's been so long since I've seen the ocean I guess I should  
  
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

I wish I was beautiful

Cut Maria! Show me some of them Spanish dances  
Pass me a bottle, Mr. Jones  
Believe in me  
Help me believe in anything

When everybody loves me, I will never be lonely  
  
I want to be a lion  
Everybody wants to pass as cats  
We all want to be big big stars, but we got different reasons for that Believe  
in me because I don't believe in anything

Yeah we star at the beautiful women  
""She's perfect for you, Man, there's got to be somebody for me.""  
I want to be Bob Dylan  
Mr. Jones wishes he was someone just a little more funky  
When everybody loves you, son, that's just about as funky as you can be

I tried to be chill but you're so hot that I melted  
I fell right through the cracks  
And now I'm trying to get back  
Before the cool done run out  
I'll be giving it my bestest  
And nothing's going to stop me but divine intervention  
I reckon it's again my turn,  
To win some or learn some  
  
But I won't hesitate no more, no more  
It cannot wait, I'm yours  
  
Well open up your mind and see like me  
Open up your plans and damn you're free  
Look into your heart and you'll find love love love love  
Listen to the music of the moment people dance and sing  
We are just one big family  
And It's our God-forsaken right to be loved loved loved loved loved

So I won't hesitate no more, no more  
It cannot wait I'm sure

This is our fate, I'm yours  
  
I've been spending way too long checking my tongue in the mirror  
And bending over backwards just to try to see it clearer  
But my breath fogged up the glass  
And so I drew a new face and I laughed  
I guess what I been saying is there ain't no better reason  
To rid yourself of vanity and just go with the seasons  
It's what we aim to do  
Our name is our virtue  
  
But I won't hesitate no more, no more  
It cannot wait I'm yours  
  
Well open up your mind and see like me  
Open up your plans and damn you're free  
Look into your heart and you'll find the sky is yours  
So please don't please don't please don't  
There's no need to complicate  
'Cause our time is short  
This, oh this, this is our fate, I'm yours

[Chorus]  
Oh, what a feeling  
When we're dancing on the ceiling  
Oh, what a feeling  
When we're dancing on the ceiling  
  
The room is hot and that's good  
Some of my friends came by from the neighborhood  
The people startin' a climb the walls  
Ooh it looks like everybody is having a ball  
  
Oh, what a feeling  
When we're dancing on the ceiling  
Oh, what a feeling  
When we're dancing on the ceiling  
  
Oh, what a feeling  
When we're dancing on the ceiling  
Oh, what a feeling  
When we're dancing on the ceiling  
  
Come on!  
  
Everybody start to lose control  
When the music is right  
If you see somebody hangin' around  
Don't get uptight  
The only thing we want to do tonight  
Is go 'round and 'round  
And turn upside down  
Come on! Let's get down!  
  
So come on! Let's get loose  
Don't hold back  
'Cause ain't no use  
Hard to keep your feet on the ground  
'Cause when we like to party  
We only want to get down  
  
Oh, what a feeling  
When we're dancing on the ceiling  
Oh, what a feeling  
When we're dancing on the ceiling  
  
Oh, what a feeling  
When we're dancing on the ceiling  
Oh, what a feeling  
When we're dancing on the ceiling  
  
Say what?  
Can't stop now  
Just getting started  
Everybody clap your hands  
Come on  
Everybody let's dance  
  
(Oh, oh, oh, oh)  
  
Oh, what a feeling  
When we're dancing on the ceiling  
Oh, what a feeling  
When we're dancing on the ceiling  
  
Oh, what a feeling  
When we're dancing on the ceiling baby baby  
We gonna dance all night

I got money matters weighing me down  
Oh the music may be merry, but it's only temporary  
I know Santa Claus is coming to town  
  
In the days I work my day job, in the nights I work my night  
But it all comes down to working man's pay  
Getting ready, I'm getting ready, ready for Christmas Day  
  
(Getting ready for Christmas Day  
And let me tell you, namely, the undertaker, he's getting ready for your body  
Not only that, the jailer he's getting ready for you  
Christmas Day. Hmm? And not only the jailer, but the lawyer, the police force  
Now getting ready for Christmas Day, and I want you to bear it in mind)  
  
I got a nephew in Iraq it's his third time back  
But it's ending up the way it began  
With the luck of a beginner he'll be eating turkey dinner  
On some mountain top in Pakistan  
  
Getting ready, oh we're getting ready  
For the power and the glory  
And the story of  
Christmas Day  
  
(Getting ready, for Christmas Day  
Done made it up in your mind that I'm going, New York, Philadelphia, Chicago  
I'm going, on a trip, getting ready, for Christmas Day  
But when Christmas come, nobody knows where you'll be  
You might ask me. I may be layin' in some lonesome grave  
Getting ready, for Christmas Day)  
  
Getting ready, oh we're getting ready  
For the power and the glory and the story of the  
Christmas Day  
Yes, we're getting ready  
  
(Getting ready, ready for your prayers,  
""I'm going and see my relatives in a distant land""  
Getting ready, getting ready for Christmas Day)  
  
If I could tell my Mom and Dad that the things we never had  
Never mattered we were always okay  
Getting ready, oh ready, ready for Christmas Day  
Ready, getting ready  
For the power and the glory and the story of the  
Christmas Day

Do you miss me tonight?  
Are you sorry we drifted apart?  
Does your memory stray to a brighter sunny day  
When I kissed you and called you sweetheart?  
Do the chairs in your parlor seem empty and bare?  
Do you gaze at your doorstep and picture me there?  
Is your heart filled with pain, shall I come back again?  
Tell me dear, are you lonesome tonight?  
  
I wonder if you're lonesome tonight  
You know someone said that the world's a stage  
And each must play a part.  
Fate had me playing in love you as my sweet heart.  
Act one was when we met, I loved you at first glance  
You read your line so cleverly and never missed a cue  
Then came act two, you seemed to change and you acted strange  
And why I'll never know.  
Honey, you lied when you said you loved me  
And I had no cause to doubt you.  
But I'd rather go on hearing your lies  
Than go on living without you.  
Now the stage is bare and I'm standing there  
With emptiness all around  
And if you won't come back to me  
Then make them bring the curtain down.  
  
Is your heart filled with pain, shall I come back again?  
Tell me dear, are you lonesome tonight?

The rules of someone else's game

Too late to go back to sleep

Close my eyes  
And leap

Can't I make you understand  
You're having delusions of grandeur?

Some things I cannot change  
But till I try I'll never know

Losing love, I guess I've lost  
Well if that's love  
It comes at much too high a cost  
  
I'd sooner buy defying gravity  
Kiss me goodbye, I'm defying gravity  
And you can't pull me down!  
  
Glinda, come with me. Think of what we could do together!  
  
Unlimited  
Together we're unlimited  
Together we'll be the greatest team  
There's ever been, Glinda!  
Dreams the way we planned 'em  
  
If we work in tandem  
  
There's no fight we cannot win  
Just you and I, defying gravity  
With you and I defying gravity  
  
They'll never bring us down!  
  
Well, are you coming?  
  
I hope you're happy  
I hope your happy now that your choosing this  
  
You too  
I hope it brings you bliss  
  
I really hope you get it  
And you don't live to regret it  
I hope you're happy in the end  
I hope you're happy my friend  
  
So if you care to find me  
Look to the Western sky!  
As someone told me lately  
Everyone deserves the chance to fly  
And if I'm flying solo  
At least I'm flying free  
To those who ground me  
Take a message back from me!  
  
Tell them how I am defying gravity  
I'm flying high, defying gravity  
And soon I'll match them in renown  
And nobody in all of Oz  
No wizard that there is or was  
Is ever gonna bring me down!  
  
I hope you're happy  
  
Look at her  
She's wicked  
Get her!  
  
Bring me down!  
  
No one mourns the wicked  
So we got to bring her  
  
Ah!  
  
Down!

Getting ready, I'm getting ready, ready for Christmas Day  
  
(Getting ready for Christmas Day  
And let me tell you, namely, the undertaker, he's getting ready for your body  
Not only that, the jailer he's getting ready for you  
Christmas Day. Hmm? And not only the jailer, but the lawyer, the police force  
Now getting ready for Christmas Day, and I want you to bear it in mind)  
  
I got a nephew in Iraq it's his third time back  
But it's ending up the way it began  
With the luck of a beginner he'll be eating turkey dinner  
On some mountain top in Pakistan  
  
Getting ready, oh we're getting ready  
For the power and the glory  
And the story of  
Christmas Day  
  
(Getting ready, for Christmas Day  
Done made it up in your mind that I'm going, New York, Philadelphia, Chicago  
I'm going, on a trip, getting ready, for Christmas Day  
But when Christmas come, nobody knows where you'll be  
You might ask me. I may be layin' in some lonesome grave  
Getting ready, for Christmas Day)  
  
Getting ready, oh we're getting ready  
For the power and the glory and the story of the  
Christmas Day  
Yes, we're getting ready  
  
(Getting ready, ready for your prayers,  
""I'm going and see my relatives in a distant land""  
Getting ready, getting ready for Christmas Day)  
  
If I could tell my Mom and Dad that the things we never had  
Never mattered we were always okay  
Getting ready, oh ready, ready for Christmas Day  
Ready, getting ready  
For the power and the glory and the story of the  
Christmas Day

Maybe we make a deal  
Maybe together we can get somewhere

Me, myself I got nothing to prove  
  
You got a fast car  
I got a plan to get us out of here  
I been working at the convenience store  
Managed to save just a little bit of money  
Won't have to drive too far  
Just 'cross the border and into the city  
You and I can both get jobs  
And finally see what it means to be living  
  
You see my old man's got a problem  
He live with the bottle that's the way it is  
He says his body's too old for working  
His body's too young to look like his  
My mama went off and left him  
She wanted more from life than he could give  
I said somebody's got to take care of him  
So I quit school and that's what I did  
  
You got a fast car  
Is it fast enough so we can fly away

City lights lay out before us  
And your arm felt nice wrapped 'round my shoulder  
I had a feeling that I belonged  
I had a feeling I could be someone, be someone, be someone  
  
You got a fast car  
We go cruising to entertain ourselves  
You still ain't got a job  
I work in a market as a checkout girl  
I know things will get better  
You'll find work and I'll get promoted  
We'll move out of the shelter  
Buy a bigger house and live in the suburbs  
  
I remember we were driving, driving in your car  
Speed so fast I felt like I was drunk

You got a fast car  
I got a job that pays all our bills  
You stay out drinking late at the bar  
See more of your friends than you do of your kids  
I'd always hoped for better  
Thought maybe together you and me would find it  
I got no plans I ain't going nowhere  
So take your fast car and keep on driving  
  
I remember we were driving, driving in your car

Makin' love to his tonic and gin

I'm not really sure how it goes  
But it's sad and it's sweet and I knew it complete  
When I wore a younger man's clothes.""

He gets me my drinks for free  
And he's quick with a joke or to light up your smoke  
But there's someplace that he'd rather be  
He says, ""Bill, I believe this is killing me.""

""Well I'm sure that I could be a movie star  
If I could get out of this place""

Now Paul is a real estate novelist  
Who never had time for a wife  
And he's talkin' with Davy, who's still in the Navy  
And probably will be for life  
  
And the waitress is practicing politics  
As the businessmen slowly get stoned  
Yes, they're sharing a drink they call loneliness  
But it's better than drinkin' alone  
  
Sing us a song you're the piano man  
Sing us a song tonight  
Well we're all in the mood for a melody  
And you got us feeling alright  
  
It's a pretty good crowd for a Saturday  
And the manager gives me a smile  
'Cause he knows that it's me they've been comin' to see  
To forget about life for a while  
And the piano, it sounds like a carnival  
And the microphone smells like a beer  
And they sit at the bar and put bread in my jar  
And say, ""Man, what are you doin' here?""  
  
Oh, la la la, di da da

Frameless heads on nameless walls  
With eyes that watch the world and can't forget

A silver thorn, a bloody rose  
Lie crushed and broken on the virgin snow

Don't know you're not home.  
  
But I can see you,  
Your brown skin shining in the sun.  
You got your hair combed back  
And your sunglasses on, baby.  
I can tell you my love for you will still be strong  
After the boys of summer have gone.  
  
I never will forget those nights.  
I wonder if it was a dream.  
Remember how you made me crazy,  
Remember how I made you scream.  
I don't understand what happened to our love.  
But, baby, I'm gonna get you back,  
I'm gonna show you what I'm made of.  
  
I can see you,  
Your brown skin shining in the sun.  
I see you walking real slow  
And you're smiling at everyone.

Out on the road today I saw a Deadhead sticker on a Cadillac.  
A little voice inside my head said:  
""Don't look back, you can never look back.""  
I thought I knew what love was.  
What did I know?  
Those days are gone forever.  
I should just let 'em go, but  
  
I can see you,  
Your brown skin shining in the sun.  
You got that top pulled down,  
And that radio on, baby.

And those Wayfarers on, baby.

Cause it's the one we'll never know  
And quit running for that runaway bus  
Cause those rosy days are few  
And, stop apologizing for the things you've never done,  
Cause time is short and life is cruel  
But it's up to us to change  
This town called malice.  
Rows and rows of disused milk floats  
Stand dying in the dairy yard  
And a hundred lonely housewives clutch empty milk  
Bottles to their hearts  
Hanging out their old love letters on the line to dry  
It's enough to make you stop believing when tears come  
Fast and furious  
In a town called malice.  
  
Struggle after struggle, year after year  
The atmosphere's a fine blend of ice  
I'm almost stone cold dead  
In a town called malice.  
  
A whole street's belief in Sunday's roast beef  
Gets dashed against the Co-op  
To either cut down on beer or the kids new gear  
It's a big decision in a town called malice.  
  
The ghost of a steam train, echoes down my track  
It's at the moment bound for nowhere  
Just going round and round  
Playground kids and creaking swings  
Lost laughter in the breeze  
I could go on for hours and I probably will  
But I'd sooner put some joy back  
In this town called malice.

You fill up my senses  
Come fill me again  
  
Come let me love you  
Let me give my life to you  
Let me drown in your laughter  
Let me die in your arms  
Let me lay down beside you  
Let me always be with you  
Come let me love you  
Come love me again  
  
You fill up my senses  
Like a night in a forest  
Like the mountains in springtime  
Like a walk in the rain  
Like a storm in the desert  
Like a sleepy blue ocean  
You fill up my senses  
Come fill me again

I want a ticket to anywhere  
Maybe we make a deal  
Maybe together we can get somewhere  
Anyplace is better  
Starting from zero got nothing to lose  
Maybe we'll make something  
Me, myself I got nothing to prove  
  
You got a fast car  
I got a plan to get us out of here  
I been working at the convenience store  
Managed to save just a little bit of money  
Won't have to drive too far  
Just 'cross the border and into the city  
You and I can both get jobs  
And finally see what it means to be living  
  
You see my old man's got a problem  
He live with the bottle that's the way it is  
He says his body's too old for working  
His body's too young to look like his  
My mama went off and left him  
She wanted more from life than he could give  
I said somebody's got to take care of him  
So I quit school and that's what I did  
  
You got a fast car  
Is it fast enough so we can fly away  
We gotta make a decision  
Leave tonight or live and die this way  
  
So remember we were driving, driving in your car  
Speed so fast I felt like I was drunk  
City lights lay out before us  
And your arm felt nice wrapped 'round my shoulder  
I had a feeling that I belonged  
I had a feeling I could be someone, be someone, be someone  
  
You got a fast car  
We go cruising to entertain ourselves  
You still ain't got a job  
I work in a market as a checkout girl  
I know things will get better  
You'll find work and I'll get promoted  
We'll move out of the shelter  
Buy a bigger house and live in the suburbs  
  
I remember we were driving, driving in your car  
Speed so fast I felt like I was drunk  
City lights lay out before us  
And your arm felt nice wrapped 'round my shoulder  
I had a feeling that I belonged  
I had a feeling I could be someone, be someone, be someone  
  
You got a fast car  
I got a job that pays all our bills  
You stay out drinking late at the bar  
See more of your friends than you do of your kids  
I'd always hoped for better  
Thought maybe together you and me would find it  
I got no plans I ain't going nowhere  
So take your fast car and keep on driving  
  
I remember we were driving, driving in your car  
Speed so fast I felt like I was drunk  
City lights lay out before us  
And your arm felt nice wrapped 'round my shoulder

There's an old man sitting next to me  
Makin' love to his tonic and gin

I'm not really sure how it goes  
But it's sad and it's sweet and I knew it complete  
When I wore a younger man's clothes.""

Now John at the bar is a friend of mine  
He gets me my drinks for free  
And he's quick with a joke or to light up your smoke  
But there's someplace that he'd rather be  
He says, ""Bill, I believe this is killing me.""

""Well I'm sure that I could be a movie star  
If I could get out of this place""

Now Paul is a real estate novelist  
Who never had time for a wife  
And he's talkin' with Davy, who's still in the Navy  
And probably will be for life  
  
And the waitress is practicing politics  
As the businessmen slowly get stoned  
Yes, they're sharing a drink they call loneliness  
But it's better than drinkin' alone  
  
Sing us a song you're the piano man  
Sing us a song tonight  
Well we're all in the mood for a melody  
And you got us feeling alright  
  
It's a pretty good crowd for a Saturday  
And the manager gives me a smile  
'Cause he knows that it's me they've been comin' to see  
To forget about life for a while  
And the piano, it sounds like a carnival  
And the microphone smells like a beer  
And they sit at the bar and put bread in my jar  
And say, ""Man, what are you doin' here?""  
  
Oh, la la la, di da da

Frameless heads on nameless walls

Lie crushed and broken on the virgin snow

Those days are gone forever.  
I should just let 'em go, but

Nobody on the beach.  
I feel it in the air,  
The summer's out of reach.  
Empty lake, empty streets,  
The sun goes down alone.  
I'm driving by your house  
Don't know you're not home.  
  
But I can see you,  
Your brown skin shining in the sun.  
You got your hair combed back  
And your sunglasses on, baby.  
I can tell you my love for you will still be strong  
After the boys of summer have gone.  
  
I never will forget those nights.  
I wonder if it was a dream.  
Remember how you made me crazy,  
Remember how I made you scream.  
I don't understand what happened to our love.  
But, baby, I'm gonna get you back,  
I'm gonna show you what I'm made of.  
  
I can see you,  
Your brown skin shining in the sun.  
I see you walking real slow  
And you're smiling at everyone.  
And I can tell you my love for you will still be strong  
After the boys of summer have gone.  
  
Out on the road today I saw a Deadhead sticker on a Cadillac.  
A little voice inside my head said:  
""Don't look back, you can never look back.""  
I thought I knew what love was.  
What did I know?  
Those days are gone forever.  
I should just let 'em go, but  
  
I can see you,  
Your brown skin shining in the sun.  
You got that top pulled down,  
And that radio on, baby.  
And I can tell you my love for you will still be strong,  
After the boys of summer have gone.  
  
I can see you,  
Your brown skin shining in the sun.  
You got that hair slicked back,  
And those Wayfarers on, baby.  
And I can tell you my love for you will still be strong,  
After the boys of summer have gone.

Free as a breeze

I apologize to anyone who can truly say

It's precious beauty lies just beyond the eye.  
It goes running through your soul  
Like the stories told of old

Ev'ry flower touched his cold hand.  
As he slowly walked by  
weeping willows  
Would cry for joy

Down in the hollow,

Our hearts a thumpin' and you

To Tuesday and so slow  
Going down the old mine

All along the water fall, with you

Sometime I'm overcome thinking 'bout  
Making love in the green grass  
Behind the stadium with you

But never two lovers  
Like music, music and me  
  
Grab a song and come along  
You can sing your melody  
In your mind you will find  
A world of sweet harmony  
  
Birds of a feather will fly together  
Now music, music and me  
Music and me

No matter what you'll do

All the flowers that you planted, mama  
In the back yard  
All died when you went away

To a place where the air is clean

There's no sense to sit and watch people die  
We don't fight our wars the way you do  
We put back all the things we use  
On Saturn  
There's no sense to keep on doing such crimes  
  
There's no principles in what you say  
No direction in the things you do

Truth and happiness just can't be bought - or sold  
Tell me why are you people so cold  
  
I'm  
Going back to Saturn where the rings all glow  
Rainbow, moonbeams and orange snow  
On Saturn  
People live to be two hundred and five  
Going back to Saturn where the people smile  
Don't need cars cause we've learned to fly  
On Saturn  
Just to live to us is our natural high  
  
We have come here many times before  
To find your strategy to peace is war  
Killing helpless men, women and children  
That don't even know what they're dying for  
We can't trust you when you take a stand  
With a gun and bible in your hand  
And the cold expression on your face  
Saying give us what we want or we'll destroy

Ah-yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah every things changing  
  
[Verse 2]  
You have given me something that I can't live without  
You mustn't underestimate that when you are in doubt  
But I don't want to carry on like everything is fine  
The longer we ignore it all the more that we will fight  
Please don't fall apart  
I can't face your breaking heart  
I'm trying to be brave  
Stop asking me to stay  
  
[Chorus]  
I can't love you in the dark  
It feels like we're oceans apart  
There is so much space between us  
Maybe we're already defeated  
Ah-yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah everything changing  
  
[Bridge]  
We're not the only ones  
I don't regret a thing  
Every word I've said  
You know I'll always mean  
It is the world to me  
That you are in my life  
But I want to live  
And not just survive  
  
[Instrumental Break]  
  
[Chorus]  
That's why I can't love you in the dark  
It feels like we're oceans apart  
There is so much space between us  
Maybe we're already defeated  
Ah-yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah everything changed me  
And I-I-I-I-I don't think you can save me

Everybody loves the things you do  
From the way you talk  
To the way you move  
Everybody here is watching you  
Cause you feel like home  
You're like a dream come true  
But if by chance you're here alone  
Can I have a moment  
Before I go?  
Cause I've been by myself all night long  
Hoping you're someone I used to know

It sounds like a song

Of when we were young

In case it is the last time that we might  
Be exactly like we were before we realised  
We were sad of getting old it made us restless

It was just like a song

I was so scared to face my fears  
Nobody told me that you'd be here  
And I swore you moved overseas  
That's what you said when you left me

It's hard to admit that  
Everything just takes me back  
To when you were there  
To when you were there  
And a part of me keeps holding on  
Just in case it hasn't gone  
I guess I still care  
Do you still care?

I was wondering if after all these years  
You'd like to meet, to go over  
Everything  
They say that time's supposed to heal ya  
But I ain't done much healing  
  
Hello, can you hear me?  
I'm in California dreaming about who we used to be

And a million miles

I'm sorry, for everything that I've done  
But when I call you never seem to be home  
  
Hello from the outside  
At least I can say that I've tried to tell you  
I'm sorry, for breaking your heart  
But it don't matter, it clearly doesn't tear you apart anymore  
  
[Verse 2]  
Hello, how are you?  
It's so typical of me to talk about myself  
I'm sorry, I hope that you're well  
Did you ever make it out of that town  
Where nothing ever happened?  
  
[Pre-Chorus 2]  
It's no secret  
That the both of us are running out of time

Hello from the other side

And the stars appear  
And there is no one there  
To dry your tears  
I could hold you  
For a million years  
To make you feel my love  
  
I know you  
Haven't made  
Your mind up yet  
But I would never  
Do you wrong  
I've known it  
From the moment  
That we met  
No doubt in my mind  
Where you belong  
  
I'd go hungry  
I'd go black and blue  
I'd go crawling  
Down the avenue  
No, there's nothing  
That I wouldn't do  
To make you feel my love  
  
The storms are raging  
On the rolling sea  
And on the highway of regret  
Though winds of change  
Are throwing wild and free  
You ain't seen nothing  
Like me yet  
  
I could make you happy  
Make your dreams come true  
Nothing that I wouldn't do  
Go to the ends  
Of the Earth for you  
To make you feel my love

Them big bulging eyes and the twisted mouth,  
Scent of magnolias, clean and fresh,  
Then the sudden smell of burning flesh.

For the rain to gather, for the wind to suck,  
For the sun to rot, for the leaves to drop,  
Here is a strange and bitter crop.

[Chorus x2]  
But when the pain cuts you deep  
When the night keeps you from sleeping  
Just look and you will see  
That I will be your remedy  
When the world seems so cruel  
And your heart makes you feel like a fool  
I promise you will see  
That I will be, I will be your remedy  
Ohhh, ohhh

Beside the victory

Building me a fence  
Building me a home  
Thinking I'd be strong there

Their minds as cold as ice  
And someone way down here  
Loses someone dear

It's simple and it's plain  
Why should I complain.

Like I used to kiss you?  
Does it feel the same  
When she calls your name?  
Somewhere deep inside  
You must know I miss you  
But what can I say  
Rules must be obeyed

The likes of me abide

A big thing or a small

And without really entering her world  
I'm glad whenever I can share her laughter  
That funny little girl  
  
Slipping through my fingers all the time

Slipping through my fingers all the time

Slipping through my fingers all the time  
  
Sleep in our eyes, her and me at the breakfast table  
Barely awake I let precious time go by  
Then when she's gone, there's that odd melancholy feeling  
And a sense of guilt I can't deny  
What happened to the wonderful adventures  
The places I had planned for us to go  
Well, some of that we did, but most we didn't  
And why, I just don't know

And save it from the funny tricks of time

Smiled like Mona Lisa

By the Eiffel tower  
I was so happy we had met  
It was the age of no regret  
Oh yes  
Those crazy years, that was the time  
Of the flower-power  
But underneath we had a fear of flying  
Of getting old, a fear of slowly dying

You send my soul sky high when your lovin' starts.  
Jitterbug into my brain,  
Goes bang bang bang till my feet do the same.  
  
But something's bugging me  
Something ain't right  
My best friend told me  
Where you were last night.  
  
Left me sleeping  
In my bed.  
I was dreaming  
But I should've been with you instead.  
  
[Chorus]  
Wake me up before you go go,  
Don't leave me hanging on like a yo-yo.  
Wake me up before you go go,  
I don't want to miss it when you hit that high  
Wake me up before you go go,  
'Cause I'm not planning on going solo.  
Wake me up before you go go,  
Take me dancing tonight.  
I want to hit that high  
  
You get the gray skies outta my way,  
You make the sun shine brighter than Doris Day.  
Turn a mere spark into a flame,  
My beats per minute never been the same.  
  
'Cause you're my lady,  
I'm your fool.  
Makes me crazy  
When you act so cruel.  
  
C'mon baby,  
Let's not fight.  
We'll go dancing  
And everything will be alright.  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Cuddle up baby,  
Move in tight.  
We'll go dancing tomorrow night.  
  
It's cold out there  
But it's warm in bed.  
They can dance,  
We'll stay home instead.

I want to be forever young  
Do you really want to live forever?  
Forever young.  
  
Some are like water, some are like the heat  
Some are a melody and some are the beat  
Sooner or later they all will be gone  
Why don't they stay young?  
  
It's so hard to get old without a cause  
I don't want to perish like a fading horse  
Youth's like diamonds in the sun,  
And diamonds are forever  
  
So many adventures couldn't happen today,  
So many songs we forgot to play  
So many dreams swinging out of the blue  
Oh let them come true  
  
Forever young,  
I want to be forever young.  
Do you really want to live forever,  
Forever, and ever?  
  
Forever young,  
I want to be forever young.  
Do you really want to live forever,  
Forever young?  
  
Forever young  
I want to be forever young  
Do you really want to live forever,  
Forever, and ever?  
  
Forever young,  
I want to be forever young.  
Do you really want to live forever?

On my way home, the state of Rome  
People gliding on the floor  
Pleased with life not needing more  
Sunset on the river  
People go home in the rain  
Familiar faces on the train  
Running scared, and staying sane  
  
If you live by the sword  
Well that's your own reward  
So don't walk with me  
Watching the wildlife  
The beast within you  
Eats your heart out  
Get free from hate and get in love  
  
Boys in the backyard  
The girls are hanging out the lines  
Washing the day, wash your troubles away  
It's game we have to play  
Ghosts are chasing you round  
Things that happen in the past  
Don't make that mistake again  
The sun beats down the streets of passion  
  
If you live by the sword  
Well that's your own reward  
So don't talk with me  
Watching the wildlife  
The beast within you  
Eats your heart out  
Get free from hate and get in love  
  
Your own worst enemy  
Get free from hate and get in love  
  
If you live by the sword  
Watching the wildlife  
Watching you  
The beast within you too  
Watching the wildlife  
  
Get in love, get in love  
  
Watching the wildlife  
We all live in a dream in home  
We watch TV and drive a car  
We go outside, but not too far  
Watching the wildlife  
We walk the water like a sun  
Living cuts you like a knife  
Living here watching the Wildlife  
  
Get in love, get in love

Don't let him take your love  
Your love from me  
Tears of love are frozen tears

All that's missing is the sea,  
But don't worry, you can suntan!  
  
Castaways and Lovers meet,  
Then kiss in Tropicana's heat,  
Watch the waves break on the bay.  
Soft white sands, a blue lagoon,  
Cocktail time, a summer's tune,  
A whole night's holiday!

Pack your bags,  
And leave tonight.  
Don't take your time,  
Gotta move your feet, don't you miss the flight!

With me and the girl from Clapham  
Out on the windy common  
That night I ain't forgotten  
When she dealt out the rations  
With some or other passions  
I said ""you are a lady""  
""Perhaps"" she said. ""I may be""  
  
We moved in to a basement  
With thoughts of our engagement  
We stayed in by the telly  
Although the room was smelly  
We spent our time just kissing  
The Railway Arms we're missing  
But love had got us hooked up  
And all our time it took up  
  
I got a job with Stanley  
He said I'd come in handy  
And started me on Monday  
So I had a bath on Sunday  
I worked eleven hours  
And bought the girl some flowers  
She said she'd seen a doctor  
And nothing now could stop her  
  
I worked all through the winter  
The weather brass and bitter  
I put away a tenner  
Each week to make her better  
And when the time was ready  
We had to sell the telly  
Late evenings by the fire  
With little kicks inside her  
  
This morning at four fifty  
I took her rather nifty  
Down to an incubator  
Where thirty minutes later  
She gave birth to a daughter  
Within a year a walker  
She looked just like her mother  
If there could be another  
  
And now she's two years older  
Her mother's with a soldier  
She left me when my drinking  
Became a proper stinging  
The devil came and took me  
From bar to street to bookie  
No more nights by the telly  
No more nights nappies smelling  
  
Alone here in the kitchen  
I feel there's something missing  
I'd beg for some forgiveness  
But begging's not my business  
And she won't write a letter  
Although I always tell her  
And so it's my assumption  
I'm really up the junction

With me and the girl from Clapham  
Out on the windy common  
That night I ain't forgotten  
When she dealt out the rations  
With some or other passions  
I said ""you are a lady""  
""Perhaps"" she said. ""I may be""  
  
We moved in to a basement  
With thoughts of our engagement  
We stayed in by the telly  
Although the room was smelly  
We spent our time just kissing  
The Railway Arms we're missing  
But love had got us hooked up  
And all our time it took up  
  
I got a job with Stanley  
He said I'd come in handy  
And started me on Monday  
So I had a bath on Sunday  
I worked eleven hours  
And bought the girl some flowers  
She said she'd seen a doctor  
And nothing now could stop her  
  
I worked all through the winter  
The weather brass and bitter  
I put away a tenner  
Each week to make her better  
And when the time was ready  
We had to sell the telly  
Late evenings by the fire  
With little kicks inside her  
  
This morning at four fifty  
I took her rather nifty  
Down to an incubator  
Where thirty minutes later  
She gave birth to a daughter  
Within a year a walker  
She looked just like her mother  
If there could be another  
  
And now she's two years older  
Her mother's with a soldier  
She left me when my drinking  
Became a proper stinging  
The devil came and took me  
From bar to street to bookie  
No more nights by the telly  
No more nights nappies smelling  
  
Alone here in the kitchen  
I feel there's something missing  
I'd beg for some forgiveness  
But begging's not my business  
And she won't write a letter  
Although I always tell her  
And so it's my assumption  
I'm really up the junction

And her friends were all a little bit afraid  
When they heard what she had to say  
They all slowly backed away  
And her family took her aside and put their arms around her  
They said:  
Mary, won't you please come back to us now  
There is still time to repent for all your sins  
And Mary started to cry when she realized  
That she'd never come home again in her life  
  
Oh Mary won't you please come

(Where the suburbs met Utopia)  
  
Lost in the high street, where the dogs run  
Roaming suburban boys  
Mother's got a hairdo to be done  
She says they're too old for toys  
Stood by the bus stop with a felt pen  
In this suburban hell  
And in the distance a police car  
To break the suburban spell  
  
Let's take a ride, and run with the dogs tonight  
In Suburbia  
You can't hide, run with the dogs tonight  
In Suburbia  
  
Break a window by the town hall  
Listen, the siren screams  
There in the distance, like a roll call  
Of all the suburban dreams  
  
Let's take a ride, and run with the dogs tonight  
In Suburbia  
You can't hide, run with the dogs tonight  
In Suburbia  
  
I only wanted something else to do but hang around  
I only wanted something else to do but hang around  
(Hang around, hang around)  
  
It's on the front page of the papers  
This is their hour of need  
Where's a policeman when you need one  
To blame the colour TV?  
  
Let's take a ride, and run with the dogs tonight  
In Suburbia  
You can't hide, run with the dogs tonight  
In Suburbia  
In Suburbia  
In Suburbia

She sits in a towel with a purple hair dryer,  
She waits to get even with me.  
She hooks up her cupcakes and puts on her jumper  
Explains that she'll be late to a worrying mother,  
She meets me in Piccadilly.  
A begging folk singer stands tall by the entrance  
His song relays worlds of most good intentions,  
A fiver a ten p in his hat for collection.  
  
She talks about office she talks about dresses  
She's seen one she fancies her smile is impressing,  
So maybe I'll treat her someday.  
We queue among strangers and strange conversation  
Love's on the lips of all forms of engagements,  
All queuing to see tonight's play.  
  
A man behind me talks to his young lady  
He's happy that she is expecting his baby,  
His wife won't be pleased but she's not been round lately.  
  
The girl was so dreadful we left in a hurry  
We escaped in the rain for an Indian curry,  
At the candle lit Taj Mahal.  
My lips to a napkin I called for a taxi  
The invite of eyes made it tense but relaxed me,  
My mind took a devious role.  
  
The cab took us home through a night I'd not noticed  
The neon club lights of adult films and Trini Lopez,  
My arm around love but my acting was hopeless.  
  
We crept like two thieves from the kettle to the fire  
We kissed to the sound of the silence that we'd hired,  
Now captured, your love in my arms.  
A door opened slightly a voice spoke in worry  
Mum went to bed without wind of the curry,  
Our secret love made its advance.  
  
Like Adam and Eve we took bite on the apple  
Loose change in my pocket it started to rattle,  
Heart like a gun was just half of the battle.

Cause our hearts in big and small ways  
Will keep the love that keeps us strong  
  
And friends are friends forever  
If the Lord's the Lord of them  
And a friend will not say ""Never""  
Cause the welcome will not end  
Though it's hard to let you go  
In the Father's hands we know  
That a lifetime's not too long  
To live as friends  
  
With the faith and love God's given  
Springing from the hope we know  
We will pray the joy you'll live in  
Is the strength that now you show  
But we'll keep you close as always  
It won't even seem you've gone  
Cause our hearts in big and small ways  
Will keep the love that keeps us strong
