The Star Spangled Banner,Whitney Houston,0.175,0.642,0.0447,0.492,"Oh, say can you see by the dawn's early light What so proudly we hailed at the twilight's last gleaming? Whose broad stripes and bright stars through the perilous fight, O'er the ramparts we watched were so gallantly streaming? And the rocket's red glare, the bombs bursting in air, Gave proof through the night that our flag was still there. Oh, say does that star-spangled banner yet wave O'er the land of the free and the home of the brave? On the shore, dimly seen through the mists of the deep, Where the foe's haughty host in dread silence reposes, What is that which the breeze, o'er the towering steep, As it fitfully blows, half conceals, half discloses? Now it catches the gleam of the morning's first beam, In full glory reflected now shines in the stream: 'Tis the star-spangled banner! Oh long may it wave O'er the land of the free and the home of the brave! And where is that band who so vauntingly swore That the havoc of war and the battle's confusion, A home and a country should leave us no more! Their blood has washed out their foul footsteps' pollution. No refuge could save the hireling and slave From the terror of flight, or the gloom of the grave: And the star-spangled banner in triumph doth wave O'er the land of the free and the home of the brave! Oh! thus be it ever, when freemen shall stand Between their loved home and the war's desolation! Blest with victory and peace, may the heav'n rescued land Praise the Power that hath made and preserved us a nation. Then conquer we must, when our cause it is just, And this be our motto: ""In God is our trust."" And the star-spangled banner in triumph shall wave O'er the land of the free and the home of the brave! "

Then one night, the walls finally closed in, I came home late, she said ""Where have you been? You used to call and tell me, ""you're on your way."" She said, ""If this is how this is gonna be, then I quit."" She walked out the door, I lost it.

Tell me, lover, are you lonely? The thing we need is Never all that hard to find Tell me, baby, what's your story Where you come from And where you wanna go this time?

The Good Stuff,Kenny Chesney,0.612,0.62,0.0645,0.502,"Well, me and my lady had our first big fight So I drove around till I saw the neon light The corner bar. It just seemed right so I pulled up. Not a soul around but the old bar keep Down at the end lookin' half asleep But he walked up and said, what'll it be? I said the good stuff. He didn't reach around for the whiskey. He didn't pour me a beer. His blue eyes kinda went misty. He said you can't find that here. [Chorus] 'Cause its the first long kiss on a second date. Momma's all worried when you get home late And droppin' the ring in the spaghetti plate 'Cause you're hands are shakin' so much And its the way that she looks with her eyes and her hair. Eatin' burnt suppers the whole first year And askin' for seconds to keep her from tearin' up Yeah man, that's the good stuff. He grabbed a carton of milk and he poured a glass. And I smiled and said I'll have some of that. We sat there and talked as an hour passed like old friends. I saw a black and white picture and it caught my stare. It was a pretty girl with bu-font hair He said, that's my Bonnie, taken 'bout a year after we wed. He said, I spent five years in the bar when the cancer took her from me. But I've been sober three years now 'Cause the one thing's stronger than the whiskey Was the sight of her holdin' my baby girl The way she adored that string of pearls I gave her the day that our youngest boy Earl Married his high school love. And its a new t-shirt sayin' I'm a grandpa. Bein' right there as our time got small And holdin' her hand when good the Lord called her up Yeah man that's the good stuff. He said, when you get home she'll start to cry. When she says, I'm sorry, say so am I. Look into those eyes so deep in love and drink it up 'Cause that's the good stuff. That's the good stuff. "

Christmas lights glisten, I've got my eye on the door, Just waiting for you to walk in, But the time is ticking, People ask me how I've been As I comb back through my memory, How you said you'd be here, You said you'd be here. And it was like slow motion, Standing there in my party dress, In red lipstick, With no one to impress, And they're all laughing, As I'm looking around the room, But there was one thing missing, And that was the moment I knew. And the hours pass by, Now I just wanna be alone, But your close friends always seem to know When there's something really wrong, So they follow me down the hall, And there in the bathroom, I try not to fall apart, And the sinking feeling starts, As I say hopelessly, ""He said he'd be here."" And it was like slow motion, Standing there in my party dress, In red lipstick, With no one to impress, And they're all laughing, And asking me about you, But there was one thing missing, And that was the moment I knew. What do you say When tears are streaming down your face In front of everyone you know? And what do you do when the one Who means the most to you Is the one who didn't show? You should've been here. And I would've been so happy. And it was like slow motion, Standing there in my party dress, In red lipstick, With no one to impress, And they're all standing around me singing ""Happy birthday to you"", But there was one thing missing, And that was the moment I knew. Ooh, I knew. Ooh, You called me later, And said, ""I'm sorry, I didn't make it,"" And I said, ""I'm sorry too,"" And that was the moment I knew. "

But something yearns within to grow beyond infatuation. Won't you look my way once before you go And my eyes will say what you ought to know. Well you've got me standin' deaf and blind Cause I see love as just a state of mind And who knows what it is that we might find, if we try. You're walking a different direction from most people I've met. You're givin' me signs of affection I don't usually get. I don't want you to pledge your future the future's not yours to give. Just stand there a little longer and let me watch while you live. 'Cause when I see you on the street, I lose my concentration. And just the thought that we might meet creates anticipation. Won't you look my way once before you go And my eyes will say what you ought to know.

The Pretender,Jackson Browne,0.62,0.529,0.0306,0.63,I'm going to rent myself a house In the shade of the freeway Gonna pack my lunch in the morning And go to work each day And when the evening rolls around I'll go on home and lay my body down And when the morning light comes streaming in I'll get up and do it again Amen. Say it again Amen. I want to know what became of the changes We waited for love to bring Were they only the fitful dreams Of some greater awakening? I've been aware of the time going by They say in the end it's the wink of an eye When the morning light comes streaming in You'll get up and do it again Amen. Caught between the longing for love And the struggle for the legal tender Where the sirens sing and the church bells ring And the junk man pounds his fender. Where the veterans dream of the fight Fast asleep at the traffic light And the children solemnly wait For the ice cream vendor Out into the cool of the evening Strolls the Pretender He knows that all his hopes and dreams Begin and end there Ah the laughter of the lovers As they run through the night Leaving nothing for the others But to choose off and fight And tear at the world with all their might While the ships bearing their dreams Sail out of sight I'm gonna find myself a girl Who can show me what laughter means And we'll fill in the missing colors In each other's paint-by-number dreams And then we'll put our dark glasses on And we'll make love until our strength is gone And when the morning light comes streaming in We'll get up and do it again Get it up again I'm gonna be a happy idiot And struggle for the legal tender Where the ads take aim and lay their claim To the heart and the soul of the spender And believe in whatever may lie In those things that money can buy Though true love could have been a contender Are you there? Say a prayer for the Pretender. Who started out so young and strong Only to surrender. Say a prayer for the pretender Are you there for the pretender? Say a prayer for the pretender Are you there for the pretender? Are you prepared for the pretender?

Amarillo,Neil Sedaka,0.724,0.715,0.0327,0.973,"When the day is dawning On a Texas Sunday morning, How I long to be there With Marie whos waitin for me there. Every lonely city Where I hang my hat, Aint as half as pretty As where my babys at. Is this the way to Amarillo? Every night I've been hugging my pillow Dreaming dreams of Amarillo And sweet Marie who waits for me. Show me the way to Amarillo I've been weepin like a willow Crying over Amarillo And sweet Marie who waits for me. Sha la la la la la la la And Marie who waits for me. There's a church bell ringing, Hear the sound of joy that it's singing For the sweet Maria And the guy whos comin to see her. Just beyond the highway Lies an open plain And it keeps me going Through the wind and rain. Is this the way to Amarillo?............. "

All day long in the field a hoin' corn. Mommy rocked the babies at night, And read the bible by the coal oil light, And ever' thing would start all over come break of morn. Daddy loved and raised eight kids on a miner's pay. Mommy scrubbed our clothes on a washboard ever' day. Why I've seen her fingers bleed, To complain, there was no need, She'd smile in mommy's understanding way. In the summertime we didn't have shoes to wear. But in the wintertime we all got a brand new pair. From a mail order catalog Money made from selling a hog, Daddy always managed to get the money somewhere. Yeah, I'm proud to be a coal miner's daughter, I remember well, the well where I drew water. The work we done was hard, At night we'd sleep cause we were tired I never thought of ever leaving butcher holler. Well a lot of things have changed since a way back then And it feels so good to be back home again. Not much left but the floor, nothing lives here anymore, Except the memory of a coal miner's daughter "

Goodbye To Love,Carpenters,0.22,0.361,0.0277,0.382,I'll say goodbye to love No one ever cared if I should live or die Time and time again the chance for love Has passed me by And all I know of love Is how to live without it I just can't seem to find it. So I've made my mind up I must live My life alone And though it's not the easy way I guess I've always known I'd say goodbye to love. There are no tomorrows for this heart of mine Surely time will lose these bitter memories And I'll find that there is someone to believe in And to live for something I could live for. All the years of useless search Have finally reached an end Loneliness and empty days will be my Only friend From this day love is forgotten I'll go on as best I can. What lies in the future Is a mystery to us all No one can predict the wheel of fortune As it falls There may come a time when I will see that I've been wrong But for now this is my song. And it's goodbye to love I'll say goodbye to love.

Well, I told her I was lost and she told all about the Pentecost, and I seen that girl as the road to my survival, my survival. Just later on the very same night when I crept to her tent with a flashlight and my long years of innocence ended: well, she took me to the woods, sayin' ""Here comes something, and it feels so good!"", and just like a dog I was befriended, I was befriended.

Something made me smile, something seemed to ease the pain, Something 'bout the universe and how it's all connected. The park is full of Sunday fathers and melted ice cream. We try to do the best within the given time. A kid should be with his mother, everybody knows that, What can a father do but babysit sometimes.

Don't Want To Be A Fool,Luther Vandross,0.632,0.576,0.0234,0.323,"Love, what have you done? Oh, wow. I was sure up to now that she was a friend. I stayed till the end. Don't be a fool again. I once believed that love was fair. But I don't anymore. She said I'm a bore. My heart hit the floor. Don't be a fool anymore. Each time around. I tell myself it's the game of love.

Said I don't want to be a fool ever again. Whenever a fool's in love he doesn't know he's to blame. He's caught in the game. It all ends up the same. He doesn't feel the shame. He looks at love in a diff'rent way. It breaks his heart ev'rytime they all turn out strange. But he'll never change. He's never gonna change. Next time around I'll tell myself it'll be better than before I won't look back. There'll be no one tearing my heart out anymore. I just decided I can't let nobody fool me again. So I'll swear to the end. I just don't want to be a fool. (Don't want to be a fool.) Said I don't want to be a fool (ever again) No way, (I mean no more) Never again (Oo, no never) I can't be a fool, can't be. No way. No way. No way. Oo. I don't want to be. I don't want to be a fool.

(Don't wanna be a fool) Ever ever again. Don't want to be a fool Can't be a fool. Don't want to be a fool ever again. I don't want to be a fool (Never oh never oh never again.)

When the evening shadows and the stars appear And there is no one there to dry your tears, I could hold you for a million years To make you feel my love. I know you haven't made your mind up yet But I would never do you wrong. I've known it from the moment that we met, No doubt in my mind where you belong. I'd go hungry, I'd go black and blue, I'd go crawling down the avenue, There's nothing that I wouldn't do To make you feel my love. The storms are raging on a rolling sea, Down on the highway of regret. The winds of change are blowing wild and free, You ain't seen nothing like me yet. I did make you happy, make your dreams come true, There's nothing that I would not do, Go to the ends of the earth for you To make you feel my love. There's nothing that I wouldn't do To make you feel my love. "

The scene has changed now I'm without you. Walked away when the act was through. And the dream was over. It was almost like a movie The way you said goodbye. You must have a lot of time rehearsing each and every line. Now there's not a dry eye in the house. After loves curtain comes down. Listen and you'll hear the sound. Hear the sound of a heart breaking. Not a smile left on my face. The ending's just too sad to take. And there's not a dry eye. Not a dry eye in the house. The greatest story was you and me. Had it all we had everything, but now the. Story's done it's just history. The last act is over. You every line had the sweetest sound. Your every touch turned my world around. But the light came up and my world crashed down. End of show It's over. It was almost like a movie. Those nights we touched the stars. Time stood still for you and I. Now it's sad enough to make you cry. Now there's not a dry eye in the house. After loves curtain comes down. Listen and you'll hear the sound. Hear the sound of a heart breaking. Not a smile left on my face. The ending's just too sad to take. And there's not a dry eye. Not a dry eye in the house. Act one The story's just begun. Act two I fell in love with you. Act three Knew it was meant to be. Act four You don't love me no more. And there's not a dry eye in the house. After loves curtain comes down. Listen and you'll hear the sound.

Whose broad stripes and bright stars through the perilous fight, O'er the ramparts we watched were so gallantly streaming? And the rocket's red glare, the bombs bursting in air, Gave proof through the night that our flag was still there. Oh, say does that star-spangled banner yet wave O'er the land of the free and the home of the brave? On the shore, dimly seen through the mists of the deep, Where the foe's haughty host in dread silence reposes, What is that which the breeze, o'er the towering steep, As it fitfully blows, half conceals, half discloses? Now it catches the gleam of the morning's first beam, In full glory reflected now shines in the stream: 'Tis the star-spangled banner! Oh long may it wave O'er the land of the free and the home of the brave! And where is that band who so vauntingly swore That the havoc of war and the battle's confusion, A home and a country should leave us no more! Their blood has washed out their foul footsteps' pollution. No refuge could save the hireling and slave From the terror of flight, or the gloom of the grave: And the star-spangled banner in triumph doth wave O'er the land of the free and the home of the brave! Oh! thus be it ever, when freemen shall stand Between their loved home and the war's desolation! Blest with victory and peace, may the heav'n rescued land Praise the Power that hath made and preserved us a nation. Then conquer we must, when our cause it is just, And this be our motto: ""In God is our trust.""

Left out in the cold, Sight of your routine getting old. Blame some indifference inside, Taken on shapes not to selective. Just what you find. Looking for seconds of peace of mind, Pieces of something to hold on to. A job that you just can't hold down, Distracted for seconds, you're gone. Follow your ups and downs, It's safe to say that I can't tell. All sense aside. Left out in the cold, Sight of your routine getting old. Blame some indifference inside, Taken on shapes not to selective. Just what you find. Where you find it. Needing to find something, Is everything ok. I hope you find your niche, someday soon. Easy to change your phase, To move from where you stand, But you got to keep that face. Each change you plan. Wonder, is everything ok, The problem is hesitation. "

All This Time,Sting,0.637,0.463,0.0337,0.451,"I looked out across the river today. Saw a city in the fog and an old church town where the seagulls play. Saw the sad shire horses walking home in the sodium light, Two priests on the ferry. October geese on a cold winter's night. All this time the river flowed endlessly to the sea. Two priests came 'round our house tonight, One young, one old, to offer prayers for the dying to serve the final rite. One to learn, one to teach which way the cold wind blows. And fussing and flapping in priestly black like a murder of crows. All this time the river flowed endlessly to the sea. If I had my way, take a boat from the river and I'd bury the old man. I'd bury him at sea. Blessed are the poor, for they shall inherit the earth. Better to be poor than a fat man in the eye of the needle. As these words were spoken I swear I hear the old man laughing. What good is a used up world and how could it be worth having? All this time the river flowed endlessly like a silent tear. All this time the river flowed. Father, if Jesus exists then how come he never lives here? Yeah yeah. Yeah yeah. Yeah yeah. Teachers told the Romans built this place. They built a wall and a temple and an edge of the empire garrison town. They lived and they died. They prayed to their gods, but the stone gods did not make a sound. And their empire crumbles 'till all that was left Were the stones the workmen found. All this time the river flowed in the falling light of a Northern sun. If I had my way, take a boat from the river. Men go crazy in the congregations, they only get better one by one. One by one. One by one by one. One by one. (I looked out across) Sad shire horses walking home in the sodium light. (the river today) "

You've built a love but that love falls apart. Your little piece of heaven turns to grey. Listen to your heart when he's calling for you. Listen to your heart there's nothing else you can do. I don't know where you're going and I don't know why, But listen to your heart before you tell him goodbye. Sometimes you wonder if this fight is worthwhile. The precious moments are all lost in the tide, yea. They're swept away and nothing is what is seems, The feeling of belonging to your dreams. Listen to your heart when he's calling for you. Listen to your heart there's nothing else you can do. I don't know where you're going and I don't know why, But listen to your heart before you tell him goodbye. And there are voices that want to be heard. So much to mention but you can't find the words. The sense of magic, the beauty that's been When love was wilder than the wind. Listen to your heart when he's calling for you. Listen to your heart there's nothing else you can do. I don't know where you're going and I don't know why, But listen to your heart before you tell him goodbye. Listen to your heart when he's calling for you. Listen to your heart there's nothing else you can do. I don't know where you're going and I don't know why, But listen to your heart before you tell him goodbye. "

Conviction Of The Heart,Kenny Loggins,0.491,0.5,0.0377,0.406,"Where are the dreams that we once had? This is the time to bring them back. What were the promises, Caught on the tips of our tongues? Do we forget or forgive? There's a whole other life waiting to live when, One day we're brave enough To talk with conviction of the heart. And down your streets I've walked alone, As if my feet were not my own, Such is the path I chose, Doors I have opened and closed. I'm tired of living this lie, Fooling myself, believing we're right when, I've never given love, With any conviction of the heart. One with the Earth, with the sky, one with everything in life, I believe, we'll survive, if we only try. How long must we all wait to change, This world bound in chains that we live in, To know what it is to forgive, And be forgiven? It's been too many years of talking now. Isn't it time to stop somehow? Air that's too angry to breathe, water our children can't drink You've heard it hundreds of times You say you're aware, Believe and you care, But do you care enough, Where's your conviction of the heart?
